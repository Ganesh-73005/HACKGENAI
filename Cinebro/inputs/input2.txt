GHOST PROTOCOL

FADE IN.
EXT. STYX CITY – NIGHT
A decaying port city, drowning in rain and neon. The streets hum with tension.

A silhouette moves across the rooftops—LYRA KANE, clad in a black tactical suit, her face obscured by a hollow-eyed gas mask.

LYRA (V.O.) (whispered, intense)
Fear doesn’t break them. It wakes them up.


INT. STYX DOCKS – WAREHOUSE – NIGHT
GIDEON VAIN, a smug trafficker, watches as crates of bio-weapons are loaded.

VAIN
Shipment moves at dawn. No mistakes.

A WINDOW SHATTERS. Darkness.

Lyra drops from the ceiling, disappearing into the shadows.

THUG #1
What the—?

THUD. A boot crushes his knee. He SCREAMS.

Gunfire ERUPTS. Lyra moves like smoke—disarming, striking, vanishing.

VAIN (draws a pistol, snarling)
You’re just some freak in a mask!

LYRA (from the dark, rasping)
No. I’m the consequence.


She TACKLES VAIN through a glass table.

SMASH CUT TO:
EXT. EASTERN EUROPEAN WILDERNESS – DAY (FLASHBACK)
A younger LYRA crawls through snow, bloodied, behind her—a burned-out CIA safehouse.

A figure materializes—SERGEI VOLK, ex-GRU, face scarred by frostbite.

VOLK
You want to hunt wolves? Become worse than them.


INT. VOLK’S COMPOUND – NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
Lyra trains under Volk’s brutal regime—interrogation resistance, stealth kills, fear tactics.

VOLK (stops her mid-strike)
Rage is loud. Terror… is silent.



LYRA (panting)
I want to burn Vain’s empire down.

VOLK
Then stop playing soldier. Become a ghost.

BACK TO PRESENT – INT. VAIN’S PENTHOUSE – NIGHT
Lyra infiltrates, hacking his database. On-screen: PLANS FOR A TOXIC ATTACK.

LYRA (V.O.)
This city doesn’t need a savior. It needs a reckoning.



FADE TO BLACK.
