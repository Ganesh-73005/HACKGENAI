Mirror Man

FADE IN:
INT. IKEA-LIKE APARTMENT – NIGHT

Pristine. Lifeless. Every item labeled with absurd product names.

ETHAN VALE (30) sits on his couch in a shirt and tie, holding a cold microwave dinner. His eyes are hollow. On TV, an ad plays:

“Your happiness is just one click away.”

He flinches. Remote clicks. Static.

ETHAN (V.O.)
I used to think I just needed the right lamp, the right mattress, the right version of me.

He stares at his reflection in the dark screen.

ETHAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Then I met him.

INT. SUBWAY – NIGHT

Crowded. Claustrophobic. Ethan stands gripping the pole.

Across from him: JAX MERCER (30s) — wild hair, paint-splattered coat, eyes that see right through people. He watches Ethan. Smirks.

JAX
You look like you're about to shatter.

Ethan looks away.

ETHAN
What?

JAX
The face. The dead-in-the-water, I-work-in-a-cubicle face.
Same one I had. Before I started breaking things.

Ethan’s confused. But something about Jax draws him in.

INT. BAR – LATER THAT NIGHT

Dark, dingy. Old punk music plays. Ethan sips a drink while Jax lights a match, stares at the flame.

JAX
You ever burned something that mattered?

ETHAN
No.

JAX
Start with your résumé.

They both laugh. Jax leans in.

JAX (CONT’D)
You want out of the loop? Come with me.

INT. PARKING LOT – MIDNIGHT

Dim. Rain falling. Jax and Ethan stand in the shadows.

JAX
Hit me.

ETHAN
What?

JAX
You’ve never felt anything real. Hit me.

Ethan punches weakly. Jax hits back, hard. Ethan falls, gasping. Then starts laughing.

ETHAN (V.O.)
The first time I felt something in years… was pain.

INT. ABANDONED BUILDING – NIGHT

Graffiti on the walls. Broken furniture arranged like a makeshift arena.

Men and women — broken by capitalism, angry, lost — stand in a circle. FIGHTING. Raw, brutal.

Jax presides. Ethan watches, eyes wide.

JAX (TO CROWD)
We are not names. Not job titles. Not credit scores.
We are ghosts in their machine. Let’s haunt them.

The crowd ROARS.

INT. OFFICE – DAY

Ethan types mechanically. Bruised knuckles. Tie tight.

Coworkers glance. Whisper. HR walks by nervously.

ETHAN (V.O.)
It was easy to go back and pretend.
Harder to pretend I wanted to stay.

INT. FIGHT DEN – NIGHT

Now Ethan fights. Brutally. Cathartically.

Jax watches with pride.

JAX
You're waking up.

INT. ETHAN’S APARTMENT – LATER

Photos scattered. Burned ID cards. Ethan paces.

Suddenly — Jax is there. But... he didn’t enter.

ETHAN
How did you get in?

JAX
You invited me.

Ethan freezes.

ETHAN (V.O.)
You ever talk to someone… and realize you’re the only one listening?

Jax fades.

INT. MIRROR – NIGHT

Ethan stares at his reflection. Jax stares back. They speak simultaneously.

ETHAN & JAX (TOGETHER)
We are the same scar in different flesh.

Ethan SCREAMS — SMASHES the mirror.

INT. CITY ROOFTOP – NIGHT

A skyline behind him. Sirens in the distance. Explosions begin in the horizon — corporate buildings going dark.

Ethan stands alone.

ETHAN (V.O.)
I thought I found him.
But I found myself.
And I wasn’t who I thought I was.

FADE TO BLACK
