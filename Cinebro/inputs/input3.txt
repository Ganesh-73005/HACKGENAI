THE EIGHTH FLOOR
INT. JURY ROOM – EVENING
A clock ticks. Disposable coffee cups everywhere. Rain spits against the small window.

FOREPERSON (50s, calm) holds a clipboard. Eleven jurors sit around a long wooden table. One seat — Juror #8 — stands by the window.

FOREPERSON
So… the vote’s eleven for guilty. One for not guilty.

JUROR #8 (early 30s, reserved) turns.

JUROR #8
I’m not saying he didn’t do it. I’m saying we haven’t talked about it.

JUROR #3 (late 40s, agitated)
Talked about it? We’ve sat through six days of evidence.

JUROR #7 (mid-20s, tired)
Man spray-painted a mosque. What more is there?

FLASHBACK – COURTROOM – DAY (IMAGINED)
A CCTV video. A masked figure spray-painting “GO BACK HOME” in red. Motion is blurry. The figure limps.

INT. JURY ROOM – EVENING
JUROR #8
We assume it’s him because he has a limp.

JUROR #5 (school teacher)
His shoes matched. And his alibi? Watching Netflix alone?

JUROR #10 (gruff)
Come on. He’s got priors for vandalism.

JUROR #8
And a Muslim name.

That gets a silence.

INT. JURY ROOM – LATER
The rain intensifies. Juror #2 quietly scribbles on a napkin.

JUROR #6 (older woman)
You really think someone else did it?

JUROR #8
I don’t know. But we’re about to ruin a man’s life.

JUROR #9 (young Black man)
It’s not just this case. It’s the whole pattern we’re asked to judge.

JUROR #3
And? That’s what patterns are for. They help connect the dots.

JUROR #8
Or they make us lazy.

FLASHBACK – DEFENDANT ON STAND – DAY (IMAGINED)
A nervous young man. Hands clasped tightly. Public defender at his side.

DEFENDANT
It wasn’t me. But I get why you think so.

INT. JURY ROOM – NIGHT
Coffee is being poured. Phones vibrate but remain ignored.

JUROR #11 (retired detective)
When I worked vice, I learned this: easiest thing in the world is to build a story around someone you already think is guilty.

JUROR #8
Exactly. That’s why we’re here — to slow it down.

JUROR #7
So what do you want? Reasonable doubt?

JUROR #8
No. I want reasoned doubt.

INT. JURY ROOM – FINAL VOTE
The foreperson looks around.

FOREPERSON
Let’s vote again. Anonymously.

Small slips of paper are passed, marked. Folded. Dropped in a file folder.

The foreperson counts. Hands tremble.

FOREPERSON
Seven guilty. Five not guilty.

Juror #3 slams her pen down.

JUROR #3
Unbelievable.

JUROR #6
Maybe not.

JUROR #8
We keep going.

FADE TO BLACK.
