FADE IN:

1950's SCI-FI FILM; Black & white, retro, stilted acting,
bad effects.

EXT. WOODS/PARKING AREA - NIGHT

This is a make-out zone. CAMERA MOVES to find the back of a
car where two teenagers are kissing. The angle is SUPER
TIGHT, the lighting dark, so we CAN'T SEE THEIR FACES.

ONE WAY TO ACCOMPLISH THIS: As we REVEAL the car, the
automatic convertible top is coming down. When we see the
couple inside, it's from behind the now scrunched rear
window. The framing of the window cuts off the tops of their
heads, hiding their antenna. Also, we see them in silhouette
so we don't see their green skin.

Dialogue starts VO as CAMERA leisurely reveals the
silhouetted couple in the car.

TEENAGE GIRL
I've never gone parking before. I'm
really not that kind of a girl.

TEENAGE BOY
I'm not the kind of a guy who would
go with that kind of a girl.

TEENAGE GIRL
That's so sweet - I think.

The boy leans closer, getting ready to kiss her.

TEENAGE BOY
There's nothing to be scared of.

And they kiss.

From the distance comes a rumbling, approaching fast. The
car starts shaking.

From the front of the car, an alien ship rises up over the
cliff. It's monstrously huge, though a cheap-looking 50's
sci-fi model.

TEENAGE GIRL
I knew this would happen if we made
out!

The teens SCREAM and the car takes off.
The car zooms down the empty road, dodging lasers from the
alien ship.

Suddenly, the car grinds to a halt, trapped. The alien ship
is about to strike when...

BLAM! It's hit with one artillery round.

REVEAL dozens of soldiers with tanks and artillery are in
position and ready for battle.

From behind the alien ship, a dozen more approach from the
sky.

The hatch of the first ship opens. An alien steps out.

CAMERA MOVES up behind a jeep. Before reaching the GENERAL,
we see his AIDE from behind.

AIDE
General, what are your orders?

Now we REVEAL the General from behind, still not seeing his
antenna.

GENERAL
This is a war for our world!

There's a CAMERA MOVE that circles around to the front of
the General that enables us to see his face. Elaborate, but
important for the FIRST REVEAL of our aliens.

GENERAL (CONT'D)
Kill every last alien!!

The frenetic glow of gunfire is reflected on the GENERAL as
we MOVE IN on his face. (NOTE: A main goal here is to create
a dynamic REVEAL that this is an alien. This needs to be
close and come up suddenly for full impact. Once we reveal
this, we need to cut very quickly to the theater of aliens
watching for the full effect.)

Suddenly they all start shooting as we...

cur TO:

INT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY

The audience watching this movie are also ALIENS with green
skin and antenna. This is an alien world (now of course in
color) going through its 1950's sci-fi movie phase.
They all wear 3-D glasses and jolt back in fear. Some munch
pop corn, girls hug their boyfriends, little boys are on the
edge of their seats. SOUND of the battle from the screen.

We MOVE among them and come to a 9 year old boy, ECKLE.
Suddenly someone pulls his 3-D glasses off. It's ECKLE'S MOM
and she's pissed. She takes him by his antenna and drags him
out of there.

EXT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY

Eckle's Mom drags her son away. This begins the OPENING
CREDIT SEQUENCE. In the scenes that follow, titles will show
up in unlikely places; billboards, store signs, traffic
signs, etc. As this introduces us to the planet, we'll hear
a light, stylized 50's SONG.

We follow Eckle and his Mom until we come to a woman walking
her stroller.

We then FOLLOW HER as she walks up to a crossing guard. The
guard does a "guchie-goo" tickle as if under the baby's
chin, but we REVEAL the baby is an egg.

They walk on and we pick up a MILKMAN and MAILMAN who greet
each other in a super friendly way.

MAILMAN
Hello Plark.

MILKMAN
Morning Serbok.

They pass kids playing HOPSCOTCH on the street. We HOLD on
them. Instead of squares, they jump in a pattern like a crop
circle.

Nearby, a beauty parlor. Inside, a suburban mom luxuriates
as her antenna are groomed.

MORE SCENES FROM BOARD ARTISTS TBD

EXT. PLANETARIUM - DAY

A car parks. Eckle's mom gets out and drags him along.
REVEAL where she's leading him:

WIDE of the planetarium as they enter.

OPENING CREDIT SEQUENCE ENDS
cur TO:

STARFIELD

A moment of silence, then MUSIC reminiscent of "Star Trek".
We hear:

A VOICE
Space. A universe of mystery. Today
the deepest secrets will be
revealed and you will see the
incredible truth!!

REVEAL we're actually seeing:

INT. PLANETARIUM/AUDITORIUM - CONTINUOUS

This is a star show in a classic 50ish planetarium. Watching
the show is an auditorium full of school kids.

Up from the middle of the room rises a platform containing
the star machine and its OPERATOR: LEM, a high-school
junior, 16, passionate, fairly geeky, yet kind of cute for
someone with green skin. It's his voice we were hearing.

He's about to continue with his lecture, but he's new and
uneasy in this job. He stumbles, dropping his script.
Bending down to pick it up, he knocks the star machine,
making it pivot 180 degrees, sending stars flying all over
the dome.

The kids OOOOH and AHHHHH, loving it, covering his mistake -â€”
or so it seems. But Lem looks over to an older man sitting
prominently in front: This is the CURATOR. He takes notes on
Lem's presentation, grading him. From his face, the grade so
far doesn't look good.

From nearby, Lem hears: PSSSST.

He turns to see SKIFF sitting nearby. Lem's age, Skiff is
quirky, paranoid. He motions for Lem to keep going and gives
him an encouraging thumbs up.

Lem makes himself continue. He hits some buttons on the star
machine as he narrates the following:

LEM
How vast is space? If you could
stretch a rope from one end to the
other, it would reach over 500
miles!!
Ooooohs from the audience.

LEM (CONT'D)
Ever try counting the stars? Don't
bother, there's too many. Over ONE
THOUSAND!

Even more Oooooohs from the audience. Lem's feeling
confident now.

LEM (CONT'D)
I'll bet you think stars are tiny
points of light. Wrong!
On the dome, Lem zooms into an individual star.
LEM (CONT'D)
Each star is over 3 feet wide!! And
so hot it can boil water!!!
The biggest set of Oooooohhhhs.

Lem brings up an image of their planet, struggling a bit to
shove the slide in the right slot.

LEM (CONT'D)

But don't worry about our planet.

It's so far from the nearest star,

nothing could ever happen to it.
Maybe the real planet is, but Lem put the slide of the
planet in wrong. It starts to catch fire, causing the
planet's image on the dome to bust into hellish flames as if
their planet is dying.
A terrified MOAN from the kids, some SCREAMING and CRYING.

KIDS
We're gonna die!/I want mommie!!!

Lem looks over at the Curator who shakes his head and makes
a note.

cur TO:

INT. PLANETARIUM/AUDITORIUM - A BIT LATER
Kids are filing out.

ON THE CURATOR, summing up Lem's score as two boys file
past. He overhears:
BOY 1
You see the whole world blow up?!!

BOY 2
I'm coming back tomorrow!!

But the Curator's not impressed.

ON LEM, waiting nearby for his score. Eckle rushes over,
speaking rapid-fire. Lem is uneasy with the Curator hear
this.

ECKLE
What about aliens? Can they really
suck out our brains?! How do you
spot an alien zombie? Are you in
the 'they don't blink' school or
the 'show no emotion' school?

Eckle is interrupted as Lem covers his mouth and looks
uneasily to the curator.

LEM
He's a riot, isn't he? Aliens.
(to Eckle, condescends)
Science proves there's no aliens.
(to Curator)
Too many comic books.
Lem taps Eckle's head to indicate brain damage. The Curator
marks another box on Lem's score. It's not looking good.
EXT. PLANETARIUM - MOMENTS LATER
Lem comes outside, looking glum.

ON ECKLE AND SKIFF, waiting for the news. They exchange a
concerned look.

SKIFF
Did'ya get the job?

Suddenly Lem brightens. He was misleading them.
LEM
You're looking at the new junior
assistant curator!!

His friends smile. They walk on.

cur TO:
EXT. TOWN STREET - A BIT LATER

Lem, Skiff and Eckle are upbeat, walking walk down a
suburban street. We see more of the neighborhood part of
this town.

The Milkman passes by and calls:

MILKMAN
How'd you do, Lem?

LEM
Got the job!

MILKMAN
Knew you would!

As they pass the Milkman, their conversation continues.

LEM
I can see my whole future! A house.
A car. Two kids. They'll grow up
and have kids. They'll come home to
visit on holidays...

In rapid fire succession:

PASSERBY 1
How'd it go?

LEM
Got it!

MAILMAN
Well?

LEM
Hired!

PASSERBY 2

Did you get it?

LEM
Thumbs up!

Lem and the others continue on.
ECKLE
Does this mean you're gonna marry
my sister?

Lem stops walking.
LEM
Whoa... let's not get ahead of
ourselves, I still have to
graduate.
(confides, happy)
But yes!

A cop car pulls up. Inside, CHIEF GORLOC speaks over his
LOUDSPEAKER.

CHIEF GORLOC
HEARD YOU GOT THE JOB. NOW GO MARRY
THAT GIRL!

Lem looks around, slightly embarrassed, but smiles anyway
and gives the Chief a thumbs up.

LEM
Thanks, Chief!

The cop car pulls way, REVEALING behind it the movie
Marquee. There we read: COMING SOON, HUMANIACS 3. Below
that, a huge poster for the movie, showing invading aliens.
A banner overhead announces: SIGN UP FOR THE PREMIERE
COSTUME CONTEST

SKIFF
(reverent)
There it is... Two more days.

ECKLE
(in movie trailer voice)
"Humaniacs 3"! The final battle for
our world has begun!

BOTH SKIFF AND ECKLE
Victory or extinction!!

They both make a high-pitched sci-fi sound. Lem sees the
sign for the costume contest.

LEM
If you guys go in costume, I'm
pretending we never met.

Lem starts to walk down the street. Skiff and Eckle follow.

SKIFF
Wait a minute, you're not going???
You said Humaniacs 2 was the best
sequel since "I Married My Alien
Abductor"!
LEM
I'm a planetarium professional now.
I don't have time for science
fiction. And I don't believe in
aliens!

SKIFF
If I didn't know better I'd say you
were an alien sent to make us think
there's no aliens!

LEM
Skiff...

Skiff stops Lem in front of a shop so he can talk to him.

SKIFF
They're here, Lem! Walking among
us! Studying us using...
(whispers,
conspiratorial)
...the anal probe.

LEM
Aliens came here to look up our
butts?

Skiff puts a hand on Lem's shoulder to emphasize:

SKIFF
The anus is the key to everything!

This is said just as a shopping woman exits a store and
winds up in the tight shot with them, in time to catch this
homoerotic sentiment. Her face drops.

Lem walks on and Skiff and Eckle follow. We leave the
shocked woman to follow them.

SKIFF (CONT'D)
The government knows! They're
hiding the evidence at Base 9! Base
9, Lem! Top, top, top, top....
extra top secret. I read all about
it at work.

LEM
You work in a comic book store!

Lem stops and points up to the comic book sign which they
happen to have just reached.

BOSS (0.S.)
Skiff!!

SKIFF
(suddenly)
I'm late!
(heading inside)
You'll believe me! When aliens
possess your parents and eat your
brain!

BOSS (0.S.)
Skiff!!!

Lem turns away and finds Eckle staring at him with an
expectant smile.

LEM
Don't listen to him. There's no
such thing as aliens.

cur TO:

EXT. CROP CIRCLE - CONTINUOUS

To contradict Lem's statement, we see an alien formation in
the grass.

REVEAL this is actually a baseball field. A game is in
progress. But flying overhead, unnoticed, is an actual alien
ship.

(NOTE: I like this scene here because it feels like a
precursor to the alien arriving and also incorporates
information about their world. Also, I'm not sure we need to
introduce Base 9 here. The key information for us now is
that an alien ship is arriving. I'm concerned we're putting
too much on our audience by introducing Base 9.)

cur TO:

EXT. LEM AND ECKLE'S HOUSES - CONTINUOUS

The two families have adjoining yards. Outside Eckle's
house, ECKLE'S DAD lights the BBQ. ECKLE'S MOM puts a cloth
over the table.

From the next yard...

LEM'S DAD (0.S.)
He got the job!!
Eckle's parents head over and we:

REVEAL LEM'S MOM and LEM'S DAD next door, talking to Lem and
Eckle. They hug Lem.

LEM'S MOM
We're so proud of you!

Eckle's parents arrive at the fence.
ECKLE'S DAD
Isn't there someone else you should
tell?
They look to the side and we REVEAL:
NEERA, working in their garden. She hasn't seen Lem yet.

Lem smiles.

ON NEERA as Lem approaches. She sees him and rises. They
face each other like two young people enamored.

LEM
Hey Neera.

NEERA
Hey Lem.

LEM

I got the job.

NEERA
That's great!!!

LEM
I was thinking, now that I have a
stable and rewarding career...

NEERA
Yes...
LEM
Maybe it's time that you and me...
NEERA
Yes...
LEM

I mean, would you wanna...

The answer would be 'â€˜yes', but before Lem can ask, SOUND of
a car pulling up with MUSIC blaring.
It's a hippy car. The driver steps out. He's Glar, 16, long
hair, flowery clothes, guitar in hand.

GLAR
Neera, where're you been? The cause
needs you!

LEM
Cause?

NEERA
Oh, Glar invented this thing he
calls "protesting". That's when you
shout about stuff that makes you
upset.

GLAR
Like the school gym. They're
painting it orange! What a bummer!
(aside)
That means I don't like it.

Glar strums his guitar and sings:

GLAR (CONT'D)
(sings)
Orange! Orange! It's so very...
(stops strumming)
What rhymes with orange?

ECKLE
(raises his hand)
I know!
GLAR

Your time will come, little man.
Neera, we need you, righteous
mamma !

Neera feels she has to go, but doesn't want to leave Lem.

NEERA
Well... Lem, is it okay if we talk
later?
LEM
(lies)
Sure.

Glar takes Neera by the arm to lead her away.

GLAR
(to Lem)
Peace. That means see ya later.

They get in the car and take off. Lem and Neera exchange a
bit of a lovelorn look.

cur TO:

INT. LEM'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Lem enters and throws down his books.
Prominent in his room is a telescope. He looks through it,
then turns to the side to speak to someone. We don't see
who.
LEM
Would you want to maybe one day get

married?

REVEAL he speaks to a picture of Neera. He moves it to mimic
her talking:

LEM (CONT'D)
(as Neera)
Oh Lem, I'd love to!
ANGLE THROUGH THE TELESCOPE. Lem hasn't seen, but entering
his scope's view is a comet-like trail in the sky - the
alien ship.

cur TO:

INT. BASE 9/RADAR ROOM - CONTINUOUS

A radar tech soldier is utterly engrossed in an alien comic
book about invaders from another planet. A RED LIGHT blinks
on the alien drawing.

REVEAL underneath his radar station has spotted a blip. He
stares in disbelief.

TRANSITION TO:

INT. BASE 9/DISPLAY ROOM - CONTINUOUS
This is down below. A top secret room. Dark. Mysterious.
We find our way to a large glass case. Inside, a NASA

Pathfinder built for roaming other planets. His name is
ROVER and he seems totally dead.
But Rover suddenly powers on. A red light starts beeping and
blinking.

His camera/eyepiece looks around. ANGLE ON HIS POV. We see a
readout: "LOCATION UNKNOWN" He tries to get out, but bumps
into the glass enclosure. More Rover POV and readout:
"Enclosure composition: GLASS" Then: "Enclosure securing:
SCREWED" (NOTE: Took a whack at a joke here that could also
be logical.)

TIGHT ON SCREWS outside the case as they are undone. REVEAL
Rover is unscrewing them from the inside. 1, 2, 3 - the
suddenly the glass case falls and smashes to the floor.

An alarm goes off. Rover leaps out of the case. He stops
behind the door as soldiers rush by without seeing him.
Rover heads out.

OUT IN THE HALL, Rover stops and looks up. MOVE IN on his
RED BLINKING LIGHT as we hear his BEEPING.

EXT. DESERT - MOMENTS LATER

Rover is on the move. He stops, picking up a signal from
above.

We see the alien ship flying over head. Seen through Rover's
POV, the readout: "TARGET ACQUIRED" "PRIMARY MISSION:
RENDEZVOUS"

Rover heads off to follow.

cur TO:

EXT. ECKLE'S BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

TIGHT ON THE SAME COMIC BOOK. Eckle reads it, sitting at his
family's outdoor table. ECKLE'S DAD works the grill. His Mom
takes his comic book away, tapping his head with it
affectionately.

Slowly, a rumbling starts. Next door, still working outside,
Lem's parents hear it too. They all wonder what's going on.
Then, from out of the sky comes a fiery rocket. A NASA
landing module approaches and slowly lands.

Pause. The hatch opens. Out steps an astronaut. Like the
first man on the moon, he charges out in self-simulated, low
gravity slow-motion and plants the American flag in the
ground. Then he looks around and realizes:
He's in suburbia on a strange planet.

Eckle's and Lem's parents stare in shock. Eckle realizes
it's a spaceman like the kind in his comic book. Beaming, he
grabs a pen to get the alien's autograph.

The astronaut, already freaked, takes a step back. Through
his POV we see Eckle's Dad holding the big fork with cooked
meat in a way that could be seen as hostile. Then the
automatic sprinkler is triggered, coming between he and his
ship. Then, Lem's Dad inadvertently ignites his grill,
sending up an scary spire of flame.

The astronaut freaks, turns and runs off down the street -
this just as Lem comes out in time to see him run off.

EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - CONTINUOUS

The NASA astronaut turns a corner and sees a woman walking
her scary looking dog. She SCREAMS. He freaks and runs the
other way.

He runs right into a car that nearly runs him over. The
people get out of the car and run one way, the astronaut
runs in the other way.

WIDE as he heads off towards the hills in the distance. On
those hills we can see the planetarium.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. ECKLE'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

FULL SCREEN TV. Speaking to camera is a TV REPORTER, a 50's,
Edward R. Murrow type, acting like the fate of the world
hinges on his every word. We see him on the monitor in B&W.

TV REPORTER
And so the war for our world has
begun. How will our species
survive? And how will YOU get your
teeth their whitest?

ON THE MONITOR, up comes a toothpaste commercial with CRUDE
ANIMATION of TOOTHPASTE BUBBLES singing a jingle:

SINGING TOOTHPASTE BUBBLES
Give your smile that special glow -
Try the sparkle action of DentaPro!
REVEAL curious townspeople have gathered to see the ship.
Police keep them back.

ANGLE ON LEM'S FRONT DOOR as he leaves the house with an arm
full of school books. He takes in the scene and seems a bit
taken aback. He looks over to Eckle's house as Neera and
Eckle also step out for school. Lem and Neera exchange a
concerned look.

cur TO:

EXT. MAIN STREET - MORNING

We see a store front established in our intro to the town
(i.e. Barbershop). Only now, instead of giving a haircut,
the barber is heading out, hastily putting on his civic
patrol uniform.

He's heading over to the civic patrol group assembling
outside, also joined by a grocer from across the street,
taking off his apron and trying to fit his too-tight
ammunition belt around his waste.

Civic Patrol citizens gather around a CIVIC PATROL CAPTAIN.
He searches through several defense manuals.

CIVIC PATROL CAPTAIN
Let's see...
(reads titles)
"Invasion by Giant Ants"; "Invasion
By Sea Monsters"; "Invasion by 50
Foot Woman"... Ah... "So You've
Been Invaded By Aliens".

ANGLE ON LEM and ECKLE'S DADS, manning a nearby artillery
gun. Eckle's Dad tips his hat to a PASSING WOMAN

PASSING WOMAN
Keep an eye out for aliens.

LEM'S DAD
Aliens?!!!

He pulls the trigger, firing the gun.

The round blasts through a billboard, knocks down a huge TV
antenna and blows the head off a statue.

Lem and Eckle's Dads whistle innocently.

cur TO:
INT. A CLASSROOM - CONTINUOUS

A teacher stands up front, holding the manual: "So You've
Been Invaded By Aliens".

TEACHER
All right, class, let's try it one
more time.
(suddenly screams)
ALIENS ARE COMING! !!!!!

At once, all the students dive and take cover under their
desks.

TEACHER (CONT'D)
(to slowest student)
Flarc, you were too slow. Go join
the zombies.

Flarc trudges back to a section of kids who linger behind a
rope, from which a handwritten sign hangs: ZOMBIES

The BELL RINGS.

INT. HIGH SCHOOL MAIN HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Kids are rushing out of their classrooms. From the
loudspeakers:

LOUDSPEAKER
Attention students, attention!
School is cancelled for the rest of
the day due to alien invasion and
the end of all life as we know it.
The stunned kids suddenly erupt in CHEERS.

cur TO:

EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS

Reminiscent of a 50's school, but with alien twists - from
the ball field to the cars in the alien lot.

As Lem leaves, he hears:

SKIFF
Psssst!

Skiff peeks out from behind a tree. Lem goes to him.
LEM
Skiff?

SKIFF
Shhhh! Replicants and zombies are
everywhere. And you said there's no
aliens!

LEM
Guess I was wrong. What do they
want from us?

SKIFF
Standard drill. Snatch our bodies.
Absorb our souls. They like our
brains with a side of hot sauce.

Skiff looks around secretly, then shows Lem some crudely
drawn architectural plans.

SKIFF (CONT'D)
I'm building an air raid shelter.
I'll have enough food for six
months if you want to come.

LEM
(yuck)
Six months underground with you?

SKIFF
(recalls)
Oh, and here, I got you this.
Skiff tosses a cork to Lem.

LEM
A cork?

SKIFF
It's your best defense against the
anal probe! You put it...
Skiff starts to gesture to his butt. Lem interrupts.

LEM
I think I know.

SKIFF
(realizes)
Oh wait, I already used that one.

Lem tosses the cork up like it was a hot coal.
While Lem

Lem turns
head.

LEM
Gross!

is busy with that, Neera comes by.

NEERA
Hey Lem. Who're you talking to?

to see that Skiff has disappeared. He shakes his

LEM
Skiff - I think. How are you
holding up?

NEERA
Fine, considering there's a space
ship in my backyard.

Suddenly Glar comes by with six TEENS, average kids he's
roped into joining his "cause".

Lem looks

GLAR
That's why we need you! You can get
us there to protest against the
men!

LEM
The who?

GLAR
You know, the men, the ones with
all the power. We need to stick it
to the men!!!
(realizes)
Why don't you join us!

LEM
Me? I have to work.

GLAR

Work!

(strums )
Establishment!

(strums )
The system!

(strums, aside to teen)
What rhymes with system?

at Neera, confused.

NEERA
I think maybe Glar's saying you
don't always have to do whatever
you're supposed to do just 'cause
someone tells you.

Neera winces a bit apologetically because she sort of feels
that way herself.

NEERA (CONT'D)
(backpedals a bit)
I think that's what he's saying.
GLAR
Outta sight. Sock it to me.
(to Neera)
You coming, foxy mamma?

With an apologetic look at Lem, Neera goes off with Glar and
the teens.

cur TO:

EXT. DESERT - CONTINUOUS

Rover is rolling along, his tracking device guiding him.
Suddenly he stops when he spots something.

REVEAL HIS POV: It's a rock. Rover's pincers grab it and
hold it up to camera. In his POV, we see a readout:

"NATIVE ROCK Composition: G7 Weight: 32 Volume: 2.19
PRIMARY SPECIMEN" (In flashing letters:) "ACQUIRE!"

ON ROVER, excited, doing a little dance and storing the rock
in his inner compartment. He continues on his journey.

WIDE REVEALS he's nearing the town. In the far distance, the
planetarium.

CUT TO:
EXT. PLANETARIUM/DOOR - CONTINUOUS
Lem puts a handwritten sign in the window: CLOSED FOR

INVASION.

INT. PLANETARIUM/MAIN EXHIBIT ROOM - CONTINUOUS
This is a huge, round atrium room with a multitude of
scientific exhibits, from a huge hanging mobile of planets
and stars to telescopes, etc.

Lem starts to prepare the place to be shut down. He doesn't
notice, but fairly well-hidden in one of the displays is the
NASA astronaut, sleeping.

MOVE IN ON THE ASTRONAUT as suddenly a light on his chest
starts to blink red just like Rover's. It wakes him up. He
stirs, knocking over something and creating a racket.

ON LEM, turning, wondering what happened, stepping over to
investigate as...

The astronaut straightens himself up and...

The TWO OF THEM STAND FACE TO FACE for the first time. A
frozen moment of terror. Suddenly:

BOTH SCREAM. And run away in opposite directions.

ANGLE ON EACH, running away, screaming. The astronaut's
screams are muffled inside his helmet. Each knocks over
things in a panic to get away.

What they don't realize is that the room is round and their
fleeing is leading them right into...

Each other. SMASH, they crash into each other and both fall.
Each sits up. Each screams.

They run away. The astronaut winds up falling into a tangle
of mobile wires and stuck in the air, as if floating in
space.

Lem keeps running until he realizes he's not being chased.
He turns and looks back.

He sees the astronaut struggling to get free.

Suddenly, on the astronaut's spacesuit, the hose gets caught
on a wire and is pulled out.

SOUND OF AIR HISSING.
ON THE ASTRONAUT, realizing he's in trouble. He checks his
oxygen gauge: It's quickly draining. Now the astronaut

panics, terrified.

ON LEM, seeing how scared he is. He feels bad for it. He
notices the wires and follows them to where they're held to
a hook in the wall. Lem gets an idea, one that's going to
take some courage.

He takes a breath and crosses to the hook. He looks back at
the astronaut.

LEM
Wish I had that cork.

Taking a brave step, he unhooks the wires. The mobile wires
- and astronaut - come crashing down.

The astronaut scrambles to his feet and looks at the gauge:
IT READS EMPTY.

Freaked, choking, he looks all around. He has no choice. He
undoes the metal lock around his helmet. He turns to the
side and slowly pulls off his helmet. We the face of:
CAPTAIN CHARLES (CHUCK) BAKER, mid-30's, handsome. His
cheeks are puffed as he holds his breath. Finally, he lets
it out and takes a scary breath. To his surprise, it's okay.
He takes another.

CHUCK
I can breathe! I can breathe!!

Remembering Lem, he turns and they face each other. A pause.

LEM
You speak my language.

CHUCK
That's amazing! You speak my
language.

LEM

That's what I just said.

CHUCK
(self-satisfied)
You just said, "That's what I just
said." Say something else!

LEM
Like what?

CHUCK
"Like - what"! They're gonna freak
back at Kennedy!
They circle each other a bit, staring. Chuck points to
himself.

CHUCK (CONT'D)
I'm Captain Charles T. Baker.
Astronaut. As-tro-naut.

LEM
Ass...

CHUCK
Â«.-Tronaut!

LEM
(points to himself)
Lem. Lem. Lem.

CHUCK
You name is either Lem. Or Lem,
Lem, Lem.

LEM

What do you want?

CHUCK
Thanks for asking. Coffee light,
two sugars, some kind of a puff

pastry...
LEM
I mean... are you here to take over
our world and... eat our brains?
CHUCK

Whoa, what kind of sick planet is
this? First of all, none of you are
supposed to be here! The profile
said uninhabited! My mission was to
plant old glory, whack some golf
balls and head on back for my guest
spot on Oprah.

(stops, off Lem's

confused face)

What?

LEM
"Op-rah..." You were just talking
alien.

CHUCK
I'm not the alien here, you are.

LEM
You are.

CHUCK
No, you are.

LEM
You are. You came to my planet.

CHUCK
An alien planet! Heeellloooo!

LEM
(greeting)
Hello...

CHUCK
Not hello! Heeeelllooooooo!

LEM
Huh?

CHUCK
What?

A pause. Chuck takes a moment to catch his breath.

CHUCK (CONT'D)
Let's start over.

SOUND of a SIREN from outside. Chuck checks the nearby
window and sees police cars on patrol.

CHUCK (CONT'D)

Look, I've got alien Sheriff Andy
on my tail and I need to get back
to my ship. My command module's in
orbit and if I don't return in...

(checks digital readout)
.-.-74 hours it goes back to earth
without me. Capish? I need your
help.

LEM
You want me to take you to your
flying saucer?
(considers)
I don't know. I could get in
trouble. I just kind of got my
future on track...

CHUCK
Opie, you're my only shot. Of
course you could leave me stranded.
I 'spose my wife can get a job to
support our kids. Eleven of them.
Better they grow up without a
father than you get in a little bit
of trouble.

Lem sighs.

LEM
Okay, I'll take you there, but then
you're on your own!

Lem heads for the door. Chuck lingers, then follows.

CHUCK
Lem my man! Five on high! Don't
leave me hanging.

cur TO:

EXT. STREET - DAY

This is the hill leading to the planetarium. Rover comes
chugging slowly up, tired. Suddenly, a car approaches coming
the other way. Rover ducks.

WE SEE LEM drives the car with Chuck in the backseat.

With the car gone, Rover continues to roll on. But he stops
and turns, his tracking device now points the other way.
Rover heaves a tired SIGH, turns and follows the car, only
at his own, much slower pace.

INT. LEM'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

Lem drives - reaching main street. Chuck keeps low in the
backseat, but looks at the alien town in amazement. His
helmet and suit are with him.

CHUCK
I don't get it. Planet One was
supposed to be uninhabited.

LEM
(confused)
What's Planet One?

CHUCK
I took the liberty of naming your
world.
(kind of artsy)
Planet One 'cause it's my first
landing. Catchy, don'cha think?

cur TO:

EXT. ECKLE'S HOUSE - DAY

Onlookers stand behind police lines. The TV reporter is in
make-up, a napkin over his shirt. The ship is guarded by
half a dozen police including Chief Gorloc.

Lem drives up.

LEM
There it is.

MOVE IN ON CHUCK looking around. He's decisive, like a hero.

CHUCK
(decides)
Okay, here's the plan. You knock
out that cop. Then, you overpower
those two. You neutralize that one
and handcuff the big guy to the
steering wheel.

LEM
What about you?

CHUCK
I can't be seen breaking the law.
I'm a role model on account of
having the Right Stuff.

LEM
The what?

CHUCK
Right Stuff. Means I have a lot of
courage.
(ducks back cowardly)
Now go.

Lem hesitates. Chuck manages to slip the door open and
pushes Lem out of the car.

CHUCK (CONT'D)
Go, go, go.

OUTSIDE THE CAR, Lem looks around awkwardly. The nearest cop
has his back to Lem. Lem looks to Chuck who signals with a
judo chop for Lem to knock him out. Lem instinctively backs
away from Chuck, bumping into the cop who turns. REVEAL it's
Chief Gorloc.

CHIEF GORLOC
Lem? Something wrong?

Lem looks at Chuck who motions with a judo chop. Lem smiles
at the Chief uneasily.

The moment is interrupted by a rumbling as:

The army pulls up. Jeeps, tanks, trucks. Soldiers fan out.
The whole place is quickly surrounded.

The TV reporter and crew snap into action, turning to film
the army.

In Lem's car, Chuck sinks even lower to stay hidden.

CHUCK
Oh boy...

ANGLE ON THE SOLDIERS, standing back, jumping to attention.
Someone is coming, someone very very important.

ANGLE BEHIND that someone, as he walks through the row of
soldiers. This is GENERAL GRAWL. Towering, mighty. Even from
behind he's perfect, every hair of his crewcut in place, his
uniform sharp and crisp. His walk resonates authority.

Grawl suddenly stops at one soldier.

ANGLE ON THAT SOLDIER, not moving, but registering terror.
What's he done wrong? His eyes drift down over his uniform
to...

.Â»-- horror of horrors, an errant thread on his jacket. His
eyes go wide.

Finally we REVEAL the face of General Grawl. There's nothing
about him that isn't perfectly in place. He's handsome and
stern, Burt Lancaster with antenna.

GRAWL
Do you know why we call ita
uniform, son?

The terrified soldier shakes his head.
GRAWL (CONT'D)

Because when we're all uniform,
then we can see who the enemy is.
The soldier nervously reaches down and pulls off the thread.
A killer pause. Grawl walks up to the CAPTAIN to get his
first look at the ship.

GRAWL (CONT'D)
Captain, have your men search the
flying saucer.

The Captain salutes and motions to soldiers in radiation
suits who approach the ship. Others ready their rifles to
back them up.

ON CHUCK, not liking this.

ON LEM, trying to get back to the car, finding soldiers in
his way. He stops and forces a smile.

ON THE SHIP as the soldiers exit with armfuls of stuff: NASA
food, moose hair product, Vanity Fair magazine, etc. There's
also an MP3 player.

A soldier drops the MP3 player. It starts to play "Space
Oddity" by David Bowie.

They all run for cover. A horrified pause.

SONG
"Ground Control to Major Tom your
circuit's dead, there's something
wrong! Can you hear me Major Tom?"

Suddenly, three shots are fired, killing the player.
REVEAL GRAWL fired the shots.

GRAWL
This is worse than I thought.

CAPTAIN
The music, Sir?

GRAWL
That's no music I ever heard! It
must be some sort of alien mind-
control! Seal off the town! I want
that alien pilot found!

From the onlookers, a voice.

A VOICE
I protest!
REVEAL the voice belongs to Glar. Flanked by the Teens and
Neera, he steps up and gives his guitar a STRUM.

GLAR
Daddeo, you're bumming me out with
those negative vibrations!
A pause. They look at Glar blankly.

GRAWL
Never mind, Captain, the alien's
right here.

Soldiers grab Glar's arms. Neera steps forward.

NEERA
Glar's not the alien!

GRAWL
Oh no??? Then what do you call
this?!
Grawl holds Glar's long hair.

NEERA
Hair! He likes it long!

GRAWL
Very unusual. You might even say -
very alien!!

The Teacher, watching nearby, speaks up.

TEACHER
Uh, General, he does go to the high
school.
That stops Grawl.
NEERA

Glar's just trying to say the
aliens might be friendly.

(sees Lem)
Lem, you know astronomy. If an
alien came all this way wouldn't it
be smart enough to come in peace?

Lem is about to answer when he notices a soldier peering in
his car, another reaching for the door. He rushes over:

LEM
Not!!!
He stands between the soldier and the door. He looks around,
realizes he's acting suspicious and tries to cover.

LEM (CONT'D)
I mean... They're everywhere! They
want our brains with hot sauce! We
should all go home and hide!

Eckle - standing nearby - happens to look inside and catch a
glimpse of Chuck. His eyes go wide. Lem gets in the car.

GRAWL
That's a sensible young man.
(to soldiers)
Let him go.
(to bystanders)
And the rest of you, go to your
homes and wait for instructions.

The soldiers let Lem drive past. People start disbanding.
Passing Neera, Lem sees the look on her face. She's
disgusted by what he just said. Lem feels horrible, but with
all the soldiers there he has to drive away.

He pulls the car into his garage.

cur TO:

INT. LEM'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The door open, we see Lem sneaking Chuck upstairs and into
the room. As they enter, Lem goes about shutting the shades.

CHUCK
Great! Just great!

LEM
This is a disaster!

CHUCK
A TOTAL disaster!

LEM
It couldn't have gone worse!

CHUCK
You can say that again!

LEM
That look on Neera's face!
CHUCK
(look at him askew)
Who's disaster are we talking
about?

LEM
(continuing)
And I have the alien in my room! If
someone finds you here...

CHUCK
Hello, stranded astronaut in the
house! Let's keep our eye on the
prize, kid!
(points to watch)
The clock's ticking and I gotta get
back up there!

Suddenly, a knock at door. The door starts to open. It's
Lem's Mom. Lem struggles to keep it from opening all the
way.

LEM'S MOM
Lem, who's that talking?

LEM
Just the TV!

LEM'S MOM
Well turn it off and come down to
dinner.

Lem pushes against the door.

LEM
Not hungry!

LEM'S MOM
Who is, with that disgusting alien
running around, but you need your
nutrition.

LEM
Okay, be right down!

Lem's Mom goes and he closes the door with a sigh of relief.
From behind Lem...

CHUCK
Disgusting?! Did you tell her I'm
People Magazine's 37th sexiest
man?!
LEM
I have to go or she'll come back.

As Lem leaves:

CHUCK
Well what am I supposed to do?

The door closes. Chuck turns and sees himself in a full-
length mirror.

CHUCK (CONT'D)
(muses )
It's the suit that makes me look
fat.

cur TO:

EXT. SUBURBIA - CONTINUOUS
Army trucks go by. Pause. Rover peers around the corner.

Suddenly, a rock lands next to him. Rover stops, picks it
up, examines it and grows excited. Happy, he stores it in
his compartment.

Then, another rock lands by him. Rover looks up and around.
Then, all at once a handful of rocks comes down. Rover races
to catch them all, excited as can be.

WE FINALLY REVEAL SKIFF, coming out of a hole dug in his
yard. He's been digging an air raid shelter.

Skiff carries a huge rock, too big to be thrown from below.
Just as he's ready to toss it, Skiff sees Rover staring at
him. Skiff recoils.

Rover eyes the rock. He really wants it. He approaches
Skiff.

SKIFF
Don't probe me! There's nothing up
there you wanna see!

But Rover comes closer. Skiff panics. He winds up and tosses
the rock at him.

Rover catches it and dances with excitement. He holds it up,
examines it, savors it and finally stores it in his inner
compartment. He looks back at Skiff lovingly, grateful.
Skiff realizes he's next. Horrified, expecting the worst, he
runs off.

INT. BOWLING ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

Skiff enters and closes the door behind him. We don't see
where he is yet. He runs right up to camera a la the end of
"Invasion of the Body Snatchers". He shouts:

SKIFF
They're here! They're here now!!
Can't you see?!! You're next!!
(right to camera)
YOU'RE NEXT!!!

REVEAL he's inside...

THE LOCAL BOWLING ALLEY. Only a couple of people bowl. The
rest are watching invasion news on the TV. No one pays him
any attention.

ANGLE ON THE DOOR as Rover enters. He's low to the ground so
no one else notices him. He stops when he sees rack after
rack filled with bowling balls. So many rocks! He dances
with glee and turns to Skiff with love. Skiff backs up in
fear.

Suddenly, a woman sees Rover and SCREAMS. Quickly, the whole
place is in a panic as people bolt for the doors.

Soldiers enter. Rover sees and quickly races away and hides
behind a curtain.

Turns out he's hiding inside the photo booth, shaking in
fear. He sneaks a peak at the incoming soldiers through the
curtain and doing so accidentally turns on the machine and
gets 4 pictures taken. The way he looks at the flashing
light of the photo booth, it almost seems like he's posing
for them.

That draws the attention of the soldiers. They surround the
booth.

Suddenly Rover bursts out. The soldiers chase, shooting.
Rover ducks behind a rack of balls, tossing it over to make
the soldiers scatter.

Now Rover is making a dash down the lanes, dodging bullets,
heading for the pins. A small PIECE of him is shot off and
falls on the lane.

SMASH, he gets a strike.
The soldiers go after him, but can't find him in the mess of
pins. Where did he go?

END ON SKIFF, watching the whole thing, amazed.

EXT. BACK OF BOWLING ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

Rover makes it out the back door. Safe for now, he looks
around. He heads off toward's Lem's neighborhood.

cur TO:

INT. LEM'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

REVEAL CHUCK'S OUTER SPACE SUIT on the couch. He's taken it
off and wears his jumpsuit. He settles back, watching TV.

ON TV: Planet One's "Lassie", showing a monstrous alien dog
and his OWNER.

OWNER
What is it, Apgar? Is Glack in
trouble?

The dog barks 'yes' in its alien way.

Chuck turns the channel. ON TV: A VARIETY SHOW with chorus
girls doing a dance number around a Sinatra-esque crooner.

Chuck turns the channel. ON TV: Planet One's "I Love Lucy".
The HUSBAND scolds the WIFE.

HUSBAND
Maglog, we can't afford that hat!

WIFE
(Lucy-like sound)
Wuaaaahhhhhnnnn!!!

Chuck turns the channel. From barking Apgar, to dancing
girls, to crying Maglog. Around and around.

Chuck leans forward. He's having a realization a la the
Statue of Liberty moment in "Planet of the Apes".

CHUCK
No... No... It can't be...

BIG MOVE IN TO CHUCK as he dramatically realizes:

CHUCK (CONT'D)
I'm on a planet with 3 channels!
Lem enters the bedroom.

LEM
You can't stay here. You gotta go.

Chuck rises, ready for action.

CHUCK
Couldn't agree more! What's the
plan?

LEM

The plan is you get out of my life!
I said I'd take you to your ship.
Well, there it is.

Lem opens the shade to reveal the ship. There's double the
number of soldiers around, spotlights on the ship, search
lights on the sky. It's like his house has been placed in
the middle of a sci fi thriller.

Lem closes the shade, discouraged. He heads off:

LEM (CONT'D)
I'll get you a blanket and pillow.

Chuck peaks out through the blinds.
CHUCK
(half to himself)
It's a miracle I'm gonna need...

EXT. ECKLE'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Through the throng of soldiers, CAMERA MOVES below to
find...

ROVER, hiding under an army truck. He looks around and finds
his opportunity. He quickly rolls to the front of Lem's
house. He tries to get in, but it's locked. Looking around
furtively, he rolls behind some bushes to wait.

INT. LEM'S ROOM - A BIT LATER

Lem is making up Chuck's bed as Chuck brushes his teeth with
some weird alien toothpaste. The TV is on in background.

CHUCK
I know! Get me to your space
program!

LEM
We don't have a space program.

CHUCK
Really? By our 50's we were
launching rockets to explore what's

up there.

LEM
We already know what's up there.
Nothing.

Chuck is about to counter, when, from the TV:

TV ANNOUNCER
We interrupt our regular
programming for this public service
announcement.

CHUCK
These are always so boring.

Chuck's about to turn it off when, ON TV, comes a TITLE:

50'S ANNOUNCER
"What To Do When Aliens Invade"!!

This is a grainy, black and white instructional film. The TV
SHOW DISSOLVES TO A CLASSROOM. Students approach the
teacher.

STUDENT 1
Hey Professor Kipple. What's all
this guff about aliens?

ON TV, REVEAL THE TEACHER, PROFESSOR KIPPLE. Bald and short.
Though he's normally weird and perverted, he's acting like
the perfect 50's authority figure here.

PROFESSOR KIPPLE
Why Gippy, aliens aren't so scary,
once you understand them. Hit the
lights.

ON TV, Kipple throws a switch for a projector. Up comes a
CRUDELY ANIMATED 50ish version of aliens.

PROFESSOR KIPPLE (CONT'D)
Aliens are a lot like us, except
for their hypodermic fingertips,
spare set of teeth and beaks for
sucking brains out of their
victim's heads.

ANGLE ON LEM, looking at Chuck suspiciously.

CHUCK
What...?

Lem looks back at the TV.

ON TV, crude animation of pods a la â€˜Invasion of the Body
Snatchers'.

PROFESSOR KIPPLE
Aliens can replicate our bodies,
using an advanced technology called
pods. And their huge brains have
the power to turn us into zombies.

Kipple is cut off as Lem turns off the TV. He crawls into
his bed.

LEM
I'm harboring the most wanted
fugitive in the world! Yesterday my
life was all set. Now - my whole
world is upside down.

Chuck settles into his bed and looks up.
CHUCK
At least you have a world.
(realizing)
I'll probably never see mine again.
From HIGH ANGLE, PULL BACK on Chuck looking up, higher and
higher to...
EXT. PLANET ONE ORBIT - CONTINUOUS

Â«+. until we find Chuck's command module. We keep moving
THROUGH A WINDOW and inside the craft until we come to:

THE DIGITAL READOUT, linked to the one that Chuck has on his
suit. It's counting down the time left for Chuck to dock
with his ship. About 2 days and 7 hours.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. TOWN STREET - MORNING
We establish the paranoia. People on the street staring each
at each other in mistrust; a storekeeper who's frightened
and locking his door; people afraid to meet each others'
eyes.

The mail truck pulls up next to a milk truck. The Mailman
and Milkman get out and cross paths warily.

MAILMAN
Hello "Plark", if that's really
you.

MILKMAN

Have a nice day, "Serbok". Or
should I call you by your alien
name?

NEARBY a MOM pulls her boy by the arm.

BOY
I don't wanna go to school!

They come upon two soldiers.

SOLDIER 3
What's the trouble here?

BOY
(thinking fast)
My mom's an alien replicant!

SOLDIER 3
Grab her!

The Mom SCREAMS and runs from the soldiers.

EXT. LEM AND ECKLE'S STREET - CONTINUOUS

A paperboy rides his alien bike through the bright suburban
streets. He tosses newspapers as he goes, past the soldiers
bivouacked on the suburban lawns. Finally passing Lem's
house, he throws the paper.

We FOLLOW THE PAPER as it hits the front door and lands on
the front step. Suddenly Rover's arm reaches over from the
nearby bushes and snatches it.

ANGLE BEHIND THE BUSHES REVEALS ROVER, holding the paper and
ducking.

ON THE FRONT DOOR as Lem's Dad steps out. No paper. Leaving
the door open, he walks onto the walkway.
LEM'S DAD
(to himself)
That's funny, where's the paper?

When he turns back, he sees the newspaper is sitting on the
front step.

ANGLE BEHIND BUSHES shows Rover is no longer there,
presumably inside the house now.

ANGLE NEARBY as soldiers snap to extreme attention. Up walks
General Grawl.

IN THE BACKGROUND, soldiers keep working around the ship.
Some in radiation suits examine the planted American Flag
with their version of Geiger Counters.

Grawl reaches the Captain.

CAPTAIN
No trace of the alien, sir.

GRAWL
How can something so different hide
in all this beautiful sameness?

PROFESSOR KIPPLE (0.S.)
I can answer that, General.

Through the throng of soldiers, Professor Kipple approaches.
They step back. All know and respect him.

PROFESSOR KIPPLE (CONT'D)
By using its enormous brain to
control our thoughts. Even YOU
could be an alien zombie and not
know it.

GRAWL
Good point, Professor.
(to Captain, offers
sidearm)
Captain, place me under arrest!

PROFESSOR KIPPLE
No need for that. But we can't be
sure of anything. For all we know
that flag could be a doomsday
device. Pull it out of the ground,
our whole world could vaporize!

ANGLE ON THE FLAG. The soldiers with Geiger Counters have
found it clean and backed away as another soldier has just
begun to pull it out of the ground. Hearing Kipple, he
stops.

The soldier smiles uneasily and furtively slips the flag
back.

GRAWL
What do we do?

ON KIPPLE, this is what he's been leading up to.

PROFESSOR KIPPLE

Capture the alien - alive - and
bring it to me.

(hungrily)
I will unlock the secrets of its
brain!

Grawl's hand reaches in, offering a handkerchief.

GRAWL
Here, Professor, you were drooling.

A jeep drives up and screeches to a halt in front the
General. A soldier jumps out and salutes.

SOLDIER
We detained the witnesses at the
bowling alley. And we found this.

He hands Grawl the PHOTO BOOTH PICTURES OF ROVER. Grawl and
Kipple exchange a look.

GRAWL
Captain, go door to door, but find
that alien! Professor.

Grawl heads off. Kipple follows.

INT. LEM'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Lem and Chuck are sleeping, Chuck like a kid with his butt
in the air. Suddenly, a loud KNOCK.

Both bolt awake. The door starts to open. Lem dashes to
block it.

LEM
Mom, don't come in!
He tries to close it, but something's wedging it open. He
looks down to see a tire in the way. Confused, he opens the
door a bit more to find:

ROVER, looking up at Lem.

Lem backs up, terrified. Rover enters and heads to Chuck.
His beeping speeds up and indicates he's reached his
destination. Chuck sees the tracking light on his own suit
and realizes:

CHUCK
Rover? Boy am I glad to see you!

Chuck pets him on the head like a dog.

LEM
Rover?

As Chuck speaks, Lem shuts the door.

CHUCK
He's a probe we sent to take
pictures.
(realizes, scolds Rover)
A planet full of aliens and you
send back pictures of rocks??? Bad
boy! Bad Rover!

Rover hangs his head and whines. Suddenly, a knock at the
door. Lem rushes over.

LEM
Mom, don't come in!

But he's not in time and the door opens. It's Eckle who sees
Chuck and lights up.

ECKLE
I knew it! I knew it! You're the
alien! This is so neat!!! Can I get

your autograph??
Lem start drags Eckle to the door.
LEM
Eckle, this isn't a comic book,

it's serious!

Chuck finds a pen and steps over, playing the reluctant
celeb.

CHUCK
I don't mind. Comes with being a
national hero. Here ya go, son.

Chuck signs Eckle's comic book. Then notices Eckle's camera.

CHUCK (CONT'D)
How about a snapshot?

ECKLE
Yeah!

Chuck poses mightily. Eckle takes a picture.

CHUCK
Wait, I can do better, gimme a
moment.

Chuck composes himself like an actor and poses more
mightily. Eckle takes another picture.

CHUCK (CONT'D)
Get one of me looking up at the
stars.

A QUICK SUCCESSION OF SHOTS: Chuck looking up like an Apollo
astronaut; Chuck giving a thumbs up; a cheesecake pose; a
brooding headshot pose; touching Lem's finger a la
Michelangelo's Creation of Adam.

Suddenly a KNOCK at the door. Chuck and Lem exchange a
panicked look.

LEM

But the door opens. Skiff enters blabbing.

SKIFF
I saw the alien! He has giant claws
and an evil red eye! He tried to
put me in his spell, but I just
looked him right in the eye and...

Suddenly sees Rover and Chuck. Rover rushes up
affectionately and rubs Skiff's leg. Skiff faints.

They all gather around him. Lem tries to shake him awake.

LEM
Skiff? Skiff?

Skiff looks up. He sees Lem, then Rover, then Chuck. He
recoils in fear.
SKIFF
Aliens!!! Lem run, I'll hold them
off!
(aside)
Unless you wanna hold them off...

LEM
Skiff, they're friendly, trust me.

Skiff looks at Lem and realizes something horrifying. He
backs up.

SKIFF
You're not Lem! You're a replicant!
(pinches Lem)
Such an obvious fake! What've you
done with Lem?!!

LEM
(eyes windows nervously)
You gotta keep it down!

Rover sidles up to Skiff and nuzzles him. Skiff is scared at
first, but he stops and looks at Rover's cute face. Rover's
one eye blinks so adorably as he tilts his head like a dog.
Skiff melts.

SKIFF
It's kinda cute the way he does
that.

Lem jumps on the opportunity to calm Skiff down.

LEM
Look at his face. Is that the face
of evil?

SKIFF
(softening)
I don't think so.

LEM
Of course not. They need our help.
They just wanna go home.

Skiff slowly reaches out and pets Rover. Rover sidles up
affectionately.

SKIFF
(delighted)
Look, he likes me!

Suddenly, another knock at the door. Lem has had it.
LEM
Great, let's just have a party!

Lem opens the door and finds himself staring at:
TWO SOLDIERS.
SOLDIER 1
Just doing a routine search for the

alien...

Suddenly, they see Chuck and aim their files, fumbling,
nervous. They enter.

SOLDIER 1 (CONT'D)
Whatta we do?!

SOLDIER 2
I dunno!!

SOLDIER 1
Don't look at his eyes! That's how
they take over your mind!
Lem gets an idea.

LEM
That's right! Resistance is futile!

Lem clears his throat and gives Chuck a pointed look.

CHUCK
Right. Futile. Check.

Chuck holds his arms outstretched and approaches the
soldiers, making a high-pitched sci-fi HUMMING SOUND.

CHUCK (CONT'D)
Ammmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm .

SOLDIER 2
What's it doing?!

Lem holds his head in mock fear.

LEM
He's taking over our brains!!

Chuck stops a moment. What's wrong with Lem? He realizes Lem
is playing along and keeps HUMMING.
Chuck reaches out and puts a hand on each of the soldiers'
heads. He speaks like Spock. The MUSIC becomes Star Trek-
like.

CHUCK
Our minds are melding. Our minds
are one! Repeat after me. I-am-
Spock!
The soldiers exchange a confused look, but obey.

SOLDIERS
I-am-Spock!

From across the room.

SKIFF
I-am-Spock!

Skiff approaches Chuck like a zombie. Lem holds him back.
LEM
(aside to Skiff)
It's not real.
SKIFF
(haughty)
I think I know when I'm being mind-
controlled.
ON THE SOLDIERS

SOLDIER 1
It's inside my head!!

SOLDIER 2
His will is too strong!

SOLDIER 1
Command us, Master!

CHUCK
Hold that thought.

Chuck pulls Lem aside, near the window.

CHUCK (CONT'D)
Maybe they can get me on my ship.

Lem looks outside. The place is swarming with soldiers.

LEM
Too many soldiers.
Then, Lem spots the TV crew outside. A lightbulb moment.

LEM (CONT'D)
But I have another idea. You're
gonna talk to the world and tell
them your friendly. But first we
gotta get you out of here.

Lem spots the mind-controlled soldiers and realizes how.

EXT. LEM'S HOUSE/GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER

The door opens automatically, revealing an army jeep. The
mind-controlled soldiers are in the front seat, Lem and
Skiff in the backseat, Chuck and Rover hidden under the
backseat.

As the jeep starts up, Eckle climbs in.

LEM
Go home, Eckle!

But Chuck reaches out and positions Eckle as a shield to
hide behind.

CHUCK
You kiddin'? Plenty of room.
(to soldiers)
Let's go.
The jeep slowly pulls out past many soldiers who have to
step out of the way. Very tense. Finally, they pass the
soldiers and takes off.

cur TO:

EXT. TOWN HALL - CONTINUOUS
Glar stands out front with Neera and some ordinary teens.

TEEN 1
Whatta you mean 'protest'?

GLAR
We need a slogan. Something that
says it's a bummer to make war on
the aliens when we should make...
Glar can't quite think of how to finish the sentence.

NEERA
Love? Make love, not war...?

MOVE IN ON GLAR, considering. Is this the beginning of a
movement?

GLAR
Nah, that's not it.

ANGLE ON the jeep driving by. Lem looks out and sees Neera.
He smiles and waves. But she looks at him angrily. Lem looks
at the soldiers and moans to Skiff:
LEM
Great, now she thinks I'm hunting
the alien!
Lem is mortified as the jeep drives on.

cur TO:

INT. COMIC BOOK STORE - A BIT LATER

Lem and the others enter from the back door. This is a geek
paradise, with full-sized sci-fi monster cut-outs, movie
posters, props, etc.

Skiff is freaked to have everyone in the store.

SKIFF
Why does he have to be here?

Lem sits, discouraged. Chuck absently picks up a comic book.

LEM
It's just 'till we get him on TV.

CHUCK
You really think you can?

LEM
You're the biggest story in
history. The whole planet'1ll watch.

CHUCK
(ego activates)
The whole planet? Interesting.

Chuck picks up a metal toy which he uses as a mirror to
check out his reflection.

CHUCK (CONT'D)
(musing)
I left my hair products on the
ship...

(adjusts hair)
But I could improvise. Astronauts
have to deal with any kind of
emergency.

Skiff snatches the toy from Chuck.

SKIFF

Don't contaminate the merchandise!
ECKLE

Are you sure they'll believe he's

friendly?
Chuck turns to Eckle with a smile.

CHUCK
Sonny, I can handle the press. Not
to toot my own horn, but I'm
working with primo material here.

Skiff steps up to Lem

SKIFF
It has horns??!

Lem rolls his eyes. The mind-controlled soldiers, trying to
one-up each other, step up to Chuck. As each speaks, he
leans in front of the other to get closer to Chuck, each
trying to become Chucks favorite zombie.

SOLDIER 1
Master, any orders?

SOLDIER 2
Your wish is our command.

SOLDIER 1
(to Soldier 2, annoyed)
"Your wish is our command??".
Zombies say "I hear and obey"!
(to Chuck, apologizing)
He's never been a zombie before.

Chuck rolls his eyes.

CHUCK
Uh, guys, chill out.

That stops them. They look at Chuck, confused.
CHUCK (CONT'D)
Take a pill. Take a number. Take a
hike.

They exchange a confused look. Chuck points to the next
room.

CHUCK (CONT'D)
Go to your room.

Chuck sees Lem is forlorn.

CHUCK (CONT'D)
(to all but Lem)
In fact, all of you, out. We need a
minute.

Chuck shoos everyone into the next room and closes the door
so he can be alone with Lem.

CHUCK (CONT'D)
Kid, what's bugging you?

LEM
Neera.

CHUCK
What is that, like an alien hernia.

LEM
She's my girlfriend! Or, she was.
Now she hates me.

CHUCK
Hate's a strong word.
(encouraging)
Maybe it's just dislike...

LEM
Plus there's another guy. Glar.

CHUCK
You know your problem? It's not
Glar. Or Neera. It's Lem. Look at
you, you're so left brain. Or is it
right brain? Whatever, you're like
the chief of control. You gotta
loosen up.

Lem nods. Chuck checks his readout, decides:

CHUCK (CONT'D)
We got a little time. This is your
lucky day. The doctor is in!

INT. COMIC BOOK STORE/BACK ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck puts on a record - romantic music. To Lem's surprise,
he dims the light.

CHUCK
Why do chicks dig me? 'Cause I'm
handsome? â€˜Cause I'm an astronaut?
Yes - and yes. But it's also
because of Chuck Baker's three
rules of romance:

Playacting, Chuck slinks up to Lem, a hound on the prowl.

CHUCK (CONT'D)
Spot your prey. Make your move.
Show no mercy!
(as if Lem's a woman)
Hey baby, I saw you across the bar.
Are sparks flying or is this place
on fire?

Chuck gives Lem his million dollar smile. Lem is horrified.

CHUCK (CONT'D)
Now you be this chick, Neera, and
I'll be you.

Before Lem can protest, Chuck grabs him for a close dance.

CHUCK (CONT'D)
Neera, tomorrow I go to space,
perhaps never to return. Let's make
my last night on earth - sorry,
Planet One - a night we'll
remember!

Chuck dips Lem. Suddenly, the door opens. It's Skiff.
SKIFF
These guys are driving me...
(sees them, shouts)
Watch out for your anus!!!!

WHAM! Skiff beams Chuck with a nearby Sci-fi prop.

CHUCK
Owwwwwoocoooccowwww!
Chuck reels. The others rush in. Lem snatches the prop and
helps Chuck sit down.

LEM
Skiff!

SKIFF
I thought... The probe.

LEM
No Skiff, no anal probe! No mind
control!

SKIFF
(weakly)
Harvesting body parts?

Chuck GROANS.

SOLDIER 1
Master should we kill him?

Horrified, Skiff looks at Chuck. Chuck looks back at him.

CHUCK
I'm thinking...

Lem pulls Skiff aside.

LEM
Skiff... I gotta go find that TV
reporter. I need your help to keep
things under control.

SKIFF
(lights up)
Are you putting me in charge?

LEM
(lies, improvising)
Yes. You're in charge... of not
hitting anyone on the head and not
getting caught. Can you do that?

Skiff salutes enthusiastically. Lem salutes back.

LEM (CONT'D)
(to all)
No one can know we're in here,
okay?
(to Chuck)
I'll be back with the reporter.
Lem heads out.

cur TO:

INT. BOWLING ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

Bowlers from the night before lined up as soldiers examine
the place for evidence. One BOWLER sees Grawl nearby.

BOWLER
We've been here all night. We want
to go home!

GRAWL
Interesting. Could that be because
you're an alien zombie?

BOWLER
Uhm, I guess we can stay.

GRAWL
Interesting. Could that be so we
won't know you're an alien zombie?!

The poor Bowler doesn't know what to say.

CUT TO:
EXT. ECKLE'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

CAMERAMAN
This is boring.
TV REPORTER
Like they say, no news - is time

They crew nods and gets in the truck.
CUT TO:

EXT. TOWN STREET - MOMENTS LATER

Lem walks along the main street. Suddenly, the TV truck
drives past him. Turning to see it, Lem notices Neera, Glar
and the teens outside TOWN HALL. He considers going after
the truck, but has to talk to Neera.
ANGLE ON THE TEENS. They stand around aimlessly. Some carry
small signs that say things like"We protest!" and "Darn!"

TEEN 1
What happens now?

NEERA
Maybe we should shout something.

Glar considers, then takes a step forward to shout:

GLAR
We're really upset!

The teens nod approvingly, though it's not quite what Neera
had in mind.

Lem approaches them.

LEM
Neera...

She turns away, indignant.

LEM (CONT'D)
I need to talk to you.

NEERA
Shouldn't you be off killing the
alien?

LEM
I'm not trying to kill him! I'm
trying to...

NEERA
What?

Lem looks at Glar and the others, realizing:

LEM
I can't tell you.

NEERA
Lem, I always thought we'd be
together, but I'm starting to feel
like I need someone who doesn't
think inside a little box. Like
Glar says, the times, they are a
diff-er-ent. Maybe you should go.
Lem goes for broke, trying Chuck's advice. He starts to move
like a guy on the prowl, but on him it seems jerky and
weird.

LEM
Neera... Is this place on fire or
is it just hot in here?

NEERA
What?

He tries dipping her, but doesn't know how and winds up
dipping himself and falling flat on the ground.

Glar steps up and puts an arm around Neera, both standing
over Lem.

GLAR
Is this guy giving you bad
vibrations?
NEERA
(a bit sad)
Lem was just leaving.
They talk away, leaving Lem on the ground.

cur TO:

EXT. COMIC BOOK STORE - CONTINUOUS

The shades are drawn.

Nearby, the TV truck has just parked. The TV reporter and
crew get out when they hear a CRASH from inside the comic
book store. They turn and see:

Something has smacked against the inside of the front door,
moving the blind aside, enabling them to see: It was Rover.
With the blind momentarily open, they see Rover pick up a
ball and head back in, the blind closing behind him.

The TV reporter exchanges a look with his cameraman.

INT. COMIC BOOK STORE/FRONT ROOM - CONTINUOUS

REVEAL Skiff and Rover are playing fetch. Rover drops the
ball at his feet. Skiff gets the ball and pets him.

SKIFF
Good boy!
INT. COMIC BOOK STORE/BACK ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Chuck paces and checks his readout - the clock is ticking.
Eckle and the mind-controlled soldiers are with him.

ECKLE
What're you gonna say in the
interview?
That stops Chuck's pacing.
CHUCK
I dunno. "I come in peace."
Boilerplate stuff.

ECKLE
That seems kind of thin.

CHUCK
Yeah, I know...

Chuck gets into character and then starts to act out the
following as if he was reciting Shakespeare.

CHUCK (CONT'D)
"Space, the final frontier. These
are the voyages of Captain Chuck
Baker. His mission: To boldly go
where no man has gone before!!!!!"

The others CHEER. Chuck raises an eyebrow proudly.

EXT. COMIC BOOK STORE - CONTINUOUS

The cameraman has set up the camera pointing inside through
a gap in the blind.

THROUGH HIS POV we are able to see Chuck in the back room.

The sound guy quietly sticks his microphone through a small
opening in the window.

Below them, Skiff and Rover play around on the floor.

INT. COMIC BOOK STORE/BACK ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Chuck is like an actor, dying for more applause.

CHUCK
There's more where that came from!
He turns away to get into character, then turns back
ominously. He's doing Darth Vadar.

CHUCK (CONT'D)
"You're a rebel spy and a traitor
to the empire!"
EXT. COMIC BOOK STORE - CONTINUOUS

The TV Reporter and Cameraman exchange a look.

cur TO:

EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

Lem trudges along. At a TV store he notices people staring
at a TV in the window. To his horror, Lem sees on TV:

Chuck, doing his Darth Vadar. Flanked by movie monster cut-
outs in the store, he seems to be part of some terrifying
alien army.
CHUCK (ON TV)
"Soon we will crush the rebel
alliance and control the galaxy!"

Lem GASPS in horror.

Grawl and Kipple are examining a piece of Rover that was
shot off.

NEARBY, the Captain stares at the TV. He calls:

CAPTAIN

Grawl and Kipple turn to the TV and see Chuck. He's doing
the "Ah-nold" strongman pose.

CHUCK
Ahhhggghhhh! Ahhhggghhh!

Kipple examines the TV image more closely.

Lem and gang are in the jeep, minus the soldiers. Lem puts
Eckle out.

ECKLE
But...

LEM
Out!

Lem floors it just as soldiers burst through the back door.
Eckle hides behind some garbage cans.

Lem drives them away. Soldiers quickly gather up and go
after them. Skiff and Rover stay low in the backseat next to
Chuck's spacesuit.

EXT. TOWN HALL - CONTINUOUS

Chief Gorloc steps up to the protesters.

CHIEF GORLOC
You kids need to break it up.

GLAR
Why should we -- Fuzz.
(off Gorloc's questioning
look)

There's fuzz on you.

Glar picks some lint off Gorloc's uniform.

CHIEF GORLOC
Assembling without a permit is
against the law.

NEERA
So what?

GLAR
Against the law?! I didn't know
that!! Sorry, sir. Won't happen
again, sir!

NEERA
Glar...!

Neera is surprised to see him being such a weenie.

Suddenly, SOUND of GUNFIRE. They turn to see the soldiers

chasing Lem and Chuck in the jeep.
ON NEERA, shocked.

NEERA (CONT'D)

She can't believe it.

ON LEM as he drives past, meeting eyes with Chief
Gorloc is shocked. Lem is horrified.

As Lem drives on, he bemoans:
LEM

Now I'm a wanted criminal! Perfect!

EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

Gorloc.

Lem turns a corner and stops suddenly. The road ahead is

blocked. They all pile out of the jeep.

CHUCK
We'd better run!
Lem and Chuck run off. Skiff and Rover are about to follow,
but more soldiers show up. They hide behind a huge digger as
the soldiers run by.

INT. COMIC BOOK STORE/BACK ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The place is filled with soldiers. Grawl and Kipple enter.

They're led to the mind-controlled soldiers, under guard,
lazily reading comic books.

GRAWL
You men, I order you to stop being
zombies!

SOLDIER 1

Sorry, General, I think that's
against the rules.

PROFESSOR KIPPLE
Amazing! The alien's brain is so
enormous it's controlling them even
now.

Uhm, I think I'm supposed to dig a
hive for the alien queen.

Yeah, and I'm supposed to lure more
recruits.

Unless you need help with the hive.

SOLDIER 1
I'm good.
INT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY
Soldiers burst in.

UP FRONT, Lem and Chuck run along the screen. People see
Chuck and SCREAM.

ON Chuck, assuming they're screaming at the movie. He looks
up, sees a scary B&W alien monster and screams himself. Lem
pulls him along.

Skiff pokes his head out to see more soldiers. Rover sidles
up to the digger, supplicating.

Chased by soldiers, Lem and Chuck run down an alley. They
find an unlocked door and slip inside to find...

INT. LARGE RECEPTION HALL - CONTINUOUS

There's a ladies tea party in progress. As soon as Chuck and
Lem enter, the party stops dead. They all stare at Chuck. A
pause.

LEM
What now?

CHUCK
Let the Doctor handle this.

Chuck turns to the ladies and turns on the charm.
CHUCK (CONT'D)

Ladies... Who'd like to meet an

astronaut?
Suddenly, the women start screaming. Some throw things at
Chuck. He starts to run away. Around each corner, more women
are there to pelt him with food. It could be right out of
"Planet of the Apes".
Finally, Lem is at the front door and calls:

LEM
Chuck! Chuck!

Chuck sees Lem and heads over, through the barrage. Finally
the two run out to find....
EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

.+. They're completely surrounded by soldiers. There's no
escape.

ANGLE ON ROVER by the digger, realizing Chuck is in trouble.
He races over.

SKIFF
Rover....!
Skiff hangs back. Rover comes up behind the soldiers, rolls
up atop a truck and raises all his instruments to look his
most menacing.

It works. A soldier points:

SOLDIER 3
Look out! The monster!

Others turn and take over. Some shots are fired.
ON SKIFF, horrified:

SKIFF
Rover..... 2

ON LEM AND Chuck, concerned about Rover, but knowing this is
their chance. They turn and run.

Their jeep is now in the clear. They get in and drive off.

EXT. STREET/SUBURBAN STREET - CONTINUOUS

Driving through a residential area, they look ahead and see:
ECKLE'S HOUSE and Chuck's ship. Very few soldiers are on
guard. Lem and Chuck exchange a look.

EXT. ECKLE'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

The soldiers don't notice the two figures sneaking around
behind the vehicles.

Finally, Lem and Chuck make their way unseen under the ship.
Chuck carries his spacesuit.

ANGLE UNDER THE SHIP

Now Chuck can work freely. He presses some buttons and a
combination to unlock the bottom latch.

HISSSSS as the latch opens. This is it. Chuck is gonna make
it. He looks at Lem and they smile. Chuck starts to reach up
for the ladder when suddenly....

THE SHIP STARTS TO RISE, as if taking off. Chuck can't
believe his eyes. Who's piloting his ship??!
WIDER ANGLE REVEALS the ship is being lifted by a crane to
be loaded onto a large army truck. As it's lifted, Lem and
Chuck are left exposed underneath.

The half dozen soldiers stare frozen.
LEM
(aside to Chuck)
Any ideas?

Suddenly Chuck grabs hold of the American flag he planted
and waves it maniacally.

NEARBY SOLDIER
He's got the doomsday device!

Chuck looks at the flag. Okay, whatever.
CHUCK
Right, and I'm not afraid to use
itl!
Chuck throws the flag way up in the air like a spear. All
the soldiers SCREAM and dive for cover. Chuck grabs Lem and
they run for a neighbor's car nearby. They climb in.

CHUCK (CONT'D)
Quick, hot-wire the car!!

LEM
What's that?

Chuck rolls his eyes and starts to do it himself.
CHUCK
When are you people going to

evolve?!

Chuck hotwires the car. They take off as the frightened
soldiers come out of hiding.

WIDE OF SUBURBIA as Chuck and Lem drive off.

Rover is led away by soldiers. From a distance, Skiff
watches, despondent. Eckle joins him.

Grawl looms over Rover who quivers in fear and wets himself.

GRAWL (CONT'D)
You found your master before. Well
you can find him again! Where's the

Grawl bangs Rover, causing a mechanical whirring, followed
by a light beam shooting out and projecting a holographic
image.

The image shows WILLIAM SHATNER and LEONARD NIMOY in their
"Star Trek" costumes.

SHATNER
Hi, I'm William Shatner.

NIMOY
And I'm Leonard Nimoy.

Grawl and Kipple stare in disbelief.
SHATNER
We've been asked by NASA and
Paramount Studios to send our
greetings.

NIMOY
By now you've met our Pathfinder,
Rover. Its mission is simple...

SHATNER

out new life and new civilizations.
NIMOY

That is, after all, only logical.
SHATNER

So on behalf of the people of

planet earth...

NIMOY

Nimoy holds up the Vulcan split-fingers sign. Shatner tries

There's a SCUFFLE. Hard to tell who's winning.

Suddenly the lights go on. It's Skiff and Eckle.

LEM
What are you doing here?

ECKLE
We came to help! All of us.

Eckle turns to the door. Neera enters. She stares at Chuck
in wonder.

NEERA
You're the alien!

CHUCK
You are, but let's not get into

Neera turns to Lem.

NEERA
You've been helping him?

Lem simply nods. Neera's grin shows she approves. She turns

I'm Neera. I'm honored to meet you.

CHUCK
Now that's how you greet an
astronaut.

Great! Just great! First it's Glar.
Now it's Chuck! Perfect!

Lem storms off into the main auditorium.

INT. PLANETARIUM/OBSERVATORY - MOMENTS LATER

Chuck enters. Lem is staring up at the stars above. Chuck
steps up. A pause.

CHUCK

No response. So Chuck sits down next to Lem. A pause. Lem
keeps looking up at the stars, so Chuck takes a new tact. He
looks up and points.

Then we've gotta go get him!
Neera's amazed by this new Lem, but she holds out a hand.

NEERA

ECKLE
Yeah, why?

Lem smiles.

A walking scene, SLOW MOTION to music like in "The Right

alien costumes on Lem, Skiff, Eckle and Neera. With dangling
extra arms, cardboard teeth, eyes on springs, the costumes
are a weird contrast to the mightiness of the moment.

Chuck gives Lem a slow motion thumbs up. Lem returns it.
Then, as things go to normal speed, Lem turns to Skiff:

LEM
You sure no one can see my face?

SKIFF
The police'll never recognize you.

I'm more worried about my friends.

REVEAL around them, a number of locals in alien costumes,
walking towards:

EXT. MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT

We start on a huge poster for "Humaniacs 3" filled with
images of invading aliens.

REVEAL A SIGN for the costume contest as dozens gather in
makeshift alien costumes. Most costumes are pretty awful
versions of the aliens on the movie poster - many human-
like. The event has the feeling of a "Star Wars" opening.

WE FIND THE TV REPORTER, speaking to his TV camera.

TV REPORTER
Here at ground zero, undaunted by
by hordes of invading aliens, the
residents of Glipforg bravely go
about their normal routines.
ON THE TEACHER atop a makeshift stage, announcing:
TEACHER

Humaniacs to my left! Machiniacs to

my right! Fleshivores and brain

eaters in the middle!
INT. COMIC BOOK STORE - CONTINUOUS
With Kipple and Grawl busy, Rover sees there's a clear path
to the front door. And the door is open.

EXT. MOVIE THEATER - CONTINUOUS

From where they stand, Lem and Chuck can see the comic book
shop in the distance.

They exchange a look. About to head over, they each have a
hand placed on their shoulders. Have they been caught?

REVEAL it's the Teacher.

TEACHER
What great costumes! You two are
finalists.
(points to makeshift
stage)

Up on stage!

LEM
We're not here to enter the
contest.

TEACHER
Then why are you dressed like
aliens?

That draws the attention of some soldiers nearby who look at
Chuck suspiciously. Lem looks around and sees there's
soldiers everywhere. He turns back to the Teacher.

LEM
We're here to WIN the contest!
Let's go!

Lem puts an arm around Chuck who offers a thumbs up. With a
desperate look back at Neera, Lem and Chuck follow the
teacher up on stage. There's so many soldiers around, they
can't run off.
INT. COMIC BOOK STORE - CONTINUOUS

Rover looks around. No one's watching him. Working up the
nerve, he bolts for the door.

Suddenly, a Soldier sees him and readies his rifle. Before
he fires, a hand reaches out to stop him. It's Grawl.

GRAWL
Hold your fire.

SOLDIER 4
But General, it's getting away.

MOVE IN ON GRAWL who mutters softly to Rover:

GRAWL
Take us to your leader...

EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

ON ROVER, his tracking light blinking.

EXT. MOVIE THEATER - CONTINUOUS

ON CHUCK AND LEM, now on stage, looking around for a way to
get out of there. There are soldiers on either side of the
stage. Chuck doesn't see his tracking device starts
blinking.

ON THE TEACHER, stepping up to the microphone. She taps it.

TEACHER
Welcome to the "Humaniacs 3"
costume contest! Let's hear it for
the finalists!

People start CHEERING. Among the crowd, Lem's parents,
surprised to see him there.

Lem leans in to whisper:

LEM
What do we do?

Chuck lifts his helmet just slightly. Eyeing the crowd, he
grows a sly smile.

CHUCK
I say, let's give â€˜em their daily
minimum dose of Chuck.
He lowers his helmet and turns to the crowd, waving, playing
it up. They love it and CHEER.

EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

Rover rolls along. Sensing something, he stops and looks
around. Nothing's there. As he rolls on, we REVEAL he's
being tailed by soldiers.

Up ahead: The movie theater.

EXT. MOVIE THEATER - CONTINUOUS

Lem watches as fellow contestants parade for the cheering
crowd. Then, to his shock, Chuck floats by him doing the
"Moonwalk".

The crowd loves it. Chuck waves.

Lem looks out and exchanges a worried look with Neera.

ON Chuck, doing more showboating. He motions for Lem to come
join him. Lem shakes his head.

EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - CONTINUOUS

General Grawl, Kipple and soldiers are stalking Rover. He
rolls on, oblivious.

EXT. MOVIE THEATER - CONTINUOUS

Chuck is doing the twist a la Travolta in "Pulp Fiction".
People cheer.

Chuck pulls Lem over and makes him dance too.

ON LEM. He can't believe this. But as he reluctantly goes
along, the crowd cheers more.

What the hell, Lem does a little dance move. The crowd loves
it.

Lem smiles, having fun. He waves to Neera who stands with
Skiff and Eckle. She looks around nervously, then starts to
smile, especially when she sees Lem on stage showboating.

Chuck falls to the floor and does some hip-hop spins. Lem
falls to the floor and joins him.
The crowd loves it.
ANGLE ON ROVER, approaching the rear of the crowd.
REVEAL BEHIND HIM: Soldiers approach.

ANGLE ON STAGE. Chuck and Lem jump to their feet and hold up
their arms for the cheering crowd.

The Teacher steps back up to the microphone.
TEACHER

I think we have a winner! Make that

twol!
The teacher gestures to Chuck and Lem and hands them a
trophy. They each grab hold with one hand and raise it up in
the air. People cheer. Lem is thrilled.
ANGLE ON ROVER in the crowd, using his 'arms' to clap. He
looks to his side where Lem's parents stand. Lem's Mom and
Rover share a "smile". Then, she suddenly realizes what
she's smiling at and:
SCREAMS!!!
People now sees Rover and start to SCREAM and run.
The soldiers close in.

On stage, Lem and Chuck realize they're in danger. They look
around for a way to get out of there.

It's pandemonium. People screaming. Running. Soldiers
grabbing people in alien costumes, ripping off masks to find
Chuck. Neera and Eckle waving to Lem, pointing where to run.

Lem and Chuck see a clear way to escape from there. They
walk casually, playing it cool.

Rover looks around in a panic. He turns to run, but suddenly
finds himself facing General Grawl. Instantly, Rover is
surrounded by soldiers who capture him.
The Captain comes up to Grawl.
CAPTAIN

All these costumes, sir. How do we

find the alien?
Grawl looks around and spots something. He grins knowingly.

GRAWL
It's simple, Captain. The alien,
like us, is in uniform.

REVEAL Grawl is looking at Chuck and Lem.

ANGLE ON CHUCK, featuring the American Flag patch on his
shoulder.

Chuck and Lem are about to get away when suddenly a flood of
soldiers surround them, rifles drawn.

It's over.
ANGLE ON ROVER, placed into a dog carrier, a prisoner.

ANGLE ON SKIFF, watching this. He feels bad for Rover, but
then notices a discarded alien costume that looks somewhat
like Rover. He gets an idea.

Grawl steps up to Chuck and Lem. Grawl and Chuck stand face
to face for the first time. Chuck starts to take off his
helmet. A tense moment for everyone there.

Then, his face is revealed. Some people GASP. But Chuck
doesn't flinch and keeps looking at them all. A nervous
moment.

Kipple steps up and joins Grawl.

GRAWL (CONT'D)
Look at it, Professor. It's
disgusting. And it smells!

CHUCK
(defensive)
You try wearing the same suit for
three weeks and see how you smell!

Kipple steps up and examines Chuck's skull.

PROFESSOR KIPPLE
Amazing! A brain even larger than
mine!
(points to Chuck's skull)
An incision here. And here. The
brain should pop right out.

Chuck is horrified, as are Lem and friends. Even Grawl is
grossed out.

GRAWL
Why the brain, Professor?
PROFESSOR KIPPLE
Because the brain is the key to
everything.

SKIFF
Not the anus??

Lem steps forward.

LEM
You're making a mistake! He's
friendly!

Kipple turns to Lem.

PROFESSOR KIPPLE
Poor boy. He's a zombie. I'll
remove his brain too.

Lem's face drops as soldiers grab him. Neera is horrified.
Lem's Mom cries.

ON Chuck, seeing all this, then looking at Lem. He's got to
do something.

Suddenly Chuck breaks free of the guards and begins to make
that sci-fi SOUND again.

CHUCK
Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm ! t!!

People step back, scared.

He steps up to Lem, holding out his arms in that monster-
like way. He makes weird alien hypnotic motions. And his
voice sounds monotone and alien-like.

CHUCK (CONT'D)
You-are-no-longer-needed-slave! I-
release-you! Return-to-your-puny-
life!

Chuck puts his hands on Lem's head as if to squeeze his
brain. Aside, so no one else can hear, Chuck tells him:

CHUCK (CONT'D)
I'm going down anyway, kid, no need
for you to go with me. Thanks for
everything.

Now Chuck gets dramatic, making a mind-releasing gesture and
a final sci-fi SOUND.
It's over and everyone buys into it. Lem's parents run up
and embrace him. Lem is too shocked by events to respond.

LEM'S MOM
Lem!

Chuck heads back to where he was standing before.

GRAWL
How about it, Professor?

Kipple steps up to Lem and looks him over.
PROFESSOR KIPPLE
Difficult to tell.
(to Lem)

Do you still believe the alien is

friendly?
A pause. Lem looks around. His parents look at him
hopefully. Neera shakes her head. Skiff motions for Lem to
say no. Chuck offers a smile and shakes his head. Finally,
Lem looks down.

LEM
No...

PROFESSOR KIPPLE
This boy is free!

Cheers and sighs of relief.
GRAWL
All right. Let's get these aliens
to Base 9.

Chuck is taken away with a sad look of "good-bye" to Lem.
Lem is near tears.

Chuck is shoved roughly into a truck. The other soldiers
quickly load the dog carrier. Grawl gets into a nearby jeep.

People gather around Lem, further separating him from Chuck.

PULL BACK to show Lem helplessly surrounded and embraced by
the crowd as Chuck is taken away.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. DESERT ROAD - NIGHT

A low, musical intro to a SONG begins.
A convoy of army vehicles drives by.

ON ONE VEHICLE, a truck.

INT. ARMY TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

This is a huge truck. Chuck is behind bars, in a cell in the
center of the truck. He's guarded by soldiers nearby. The
dog carrier is lashed to a truck panel.

Chuck looks down at the DIGITAL READOUT. Now he has less
than a day left. As the intro ends and the SONG BEGINS,
Chuck is the one who sings: "Space Oddity". Chuck belts it
out dramatically and with lots of self-pity:

CHUCK
(singing)
Ground control to Major Tom.
(as background)
10. 9. 8.
(singing)
Commencing countdown engines on.
(as background)
5. 4.
(singing)
Check ignition and may God's love
be with you.....
(as background)
Liftoff.

As the music kicks in, we use this song to intercut between
Lem and Chuck.

EXT. LEM'S HOME - NIGHT

Lem and his family approach their home through a throng of
reporters and bystanders. The reporters take pictures of
Lem. What should be a proud moment, is sad for him.

ANGLE ON NEERA, going into her home next door. She looks at
Lem sadly. Eckle is with her.

The song continues, sung by Chuck.

CHUCK (V.O.)
(sings)

This is ground control to Major
Tom. You really made the grade.
(reporters take pictures

of Lem)
And the papers want to know whose
shirts you wear.

(on Neera, watching Lem

sadly)
Now it's time to leave the capsule
if you dare.

INT. ARMY TRUCK - NIGHT

The truck has arrived. Soldiers come and take Chuck out of
his cell as he keeps singing self-righteously. The truck is
parked at the BASE 9 containment building.

The soldiers literally LIFT CHUCK IN THE AIR and carry him
inside. They also take Rover's cage.

CHUCK
(singing)
This is Major Tom to ground
control. I'm stepping through the
door. And I'm floating in a most
peculiar way.

INT. BASE 9/CHUCK'S CELL - NIGHT

Chuck is tossed inside his cell. He looks around his new
prison cell.

CHUCK
(singing)
And the world looks very different
today!

INT. LEM'S ROOM - NIGHT

ON LEM, looking around at the stars, seemingly surrounded by
them as CAMERA 'FLOATS' around him.

CHUCK (V.O.)
(sings)
For here am I floating in a tin
can.

REVEAL Lem is at his domed roof, looking at the night sky as
we see him from an extreme HIGH ANGLE.

CHUCK (V.O.) (CONT'D)
(sings)
Far above the world.
INT. BASE 9/CHUCK'S CELL - NIGHT

We see Chuck from that same HIGH ANGLE as he looks up,
seemingly at the distant stars and earth.

CHUCK
(singing)
Planet earth is blue and there's
nothing I can do.

REVERSE shows him in his new cell. Chuck starts to do his
"BOWIE CLAP" in that affected, effeminate way. The guards
nearby watch him, weirded out.

On the SECOND CLAP we abruptly...

cur TO:

INT. PLANETARIUM/AUDITORIUM - DAY
Hands clapping in a MATCH CUT. This starts applause for...
THE TV REPORTER, getting ready to conduct a live interview.

TV REPORTER
We're here to honor a young man who
survived a harrowing ordeal at the
hands of the alien monster. Lem,
come on out!

People applaud. Among those in the audience, Neera, Eckle,
Skiff, Eckle's parents, Chief Gorloc, the Milkman, the
Mailman, the Teacher, the Curator.

ANGLE ON LEM AND HIS PARENTS, standing in the wings. Lem
seems trance-like.

LEM'S DAD
Son?

His parents exchange a bewildered look.
LEM'S MOM
You did it. You got everything you
always wanted.

LEM'S DAD
Isn't that great?

Lem nods and glumly goes out to the center. He sits by the
TV Reporter.
TV REPORTER
Lem, I understand you'll be working
right here after you graduate,
teaching about the mysteries of
space. Give us a preview.

Lem looks around, uncomfortable.

LEM
Well...
(recalls by rote)
If you were to stretch a rope from
one end of the universe to the
other, it would reach over 500
miles!

TV REPORTER
500 miles!

Impressed reaction from the audience.

LEM
(still by rote)
And have you ever tried counting
the stars? Don't bother, there's
too many. Over one thousand.

TV REPORTER
One thousand! Remarkable.

More of a reaction from the audience. That starts to snap
Lem out of it. He looks around at them, starting to realize
something.

LEM
You know what's really remarkable?
That we believe this. No one knows
how big space is. There's billions
of galaxies and each one of them
has billions of stars. Next to
that, our world is just...

Lem stops and looks around, coming fully back to life.

LEM (CONT'D)
Excuse me.

Lem walks away. Neera and Eckle exchange a look. She nods to
Skiff who takes off one way. She and Eckle go the other.

The reporter urgently motions to someone who flips a switch
that starts a typical 50's singing commercial.
cur TO:

EXT. PLANETARIUM - MOMENTS LATER

Neera and

Eckle look all around. No sign of Lem. Then, they

hear a SOUND from a nearby police car. They find Lem in the
front seat, pulling out the ignition wires.

NEERA
Lem, what are you doing?

LEM
It's called hot-wiring. I think
it's an earth custom.

Lem touches the wires. The engine starts. Lem steps up to

them.

Neera and

LEM (CONT'D)
I got my life back, but it turns
out I don't want it anymore.

Skiff exchange a confused look.

NEERA
I don't understand.

LEM
My friend's in trouble. I'm gonna
go help him.
(steps up to Neera)
Maybe you'd be better off with
Glar. Someone who can give you a
stable life with secur...

Neera suddenly hauls off and kisses Lem.

A long pause. Then, she lets him go.

LEM (CONT'D)

Or, not.
NEERA
I'm going with you!
ECKLE
Me too!
LEM

Well that's great, but I don't know
where I'm going.
Suddenly, from nearby:

SKIFF (0.S.)
Yes you do.

They turn to see Skiff with a dog carrier. He opens it to
reveal ROVER. Excited, Rover wags his 'tail' and rushes up
to Lem.

LEM
Rover!

NEERA
In all the excitement, we couldn't
tell you. Skiff pulled a switch.

Lem looks at Skiff, amazed. They exchange a smile. Lem leans
down to Rover.

LEM
Rover, where's Chuck? Can you find
Chuck???
Rover looks around as if trying to find the scent. Then
suddenly, his tracking light blinks. The direction leads far
off into the desert. Rover looks at them and nods.
SKIFF
(excited)
We're going to Base 9!!!

LEM
C'mon!

They get in the car to guitar strains of a FOLK SONG.

cur TO:

EXT. TOWN HALL - CONTINUOUS
The music comes from Glar who starts a song TBD about the
end of the protest movement. The Teens are taking apart
their protest signs.
Lem drives by and stops. He gets and idea and backs up.
LEM
Glar, how'd you like a cause you
can really sing about?

Glar stops playing and looks up.
GLAR

Dig!

(off confused faces)
Cool!

(off confused faces)
Far out!

Still no one gets it.

The Teens

GLAR (CONT'D)
What I mean to say is that would be
really desirable.

smile.

LEM
Take the desert road. We'll meet up
ahead.

Lem drives on.

cur TO:

BASE 9/CHUCK'S CELL - DAY

A dozen or so guards enter and aim their rifles at Chuck,
all terrified of him. Last, Grawl enters, looking
formidable.

GRAWL
So you thought you could take over
our world! Your kind knows no
decency!

CHUCK
My kind???
(to nearby soldier)
Did you hear that??
(to Grawl)
That is species profiling!

GRAWL

Tell us your invasion plans! And
don't bother taking over my mind.
If you do...

(points)
Captain Kizno has orders to shoot
me. If you take over Captain
Kizno's mind, Liutenant Groit has
orders to shoot him. If you take
over Lieutenant Groit's mind,
Sergeant Yerk will shoot Captain
Kizno, Lieutenant Groit and myself
along with these three soldiers.
Each soldier has a designated
target in the squad. Should you
succeed in taking over all of our
minds, Corporal Hisk...

He points to a Hisk at the far end of the room, standing by
an electric console.

GRAWL (CONT'D)
... has orders to electrocute
everyone. If all this fails, the
entire base is rigged to blow at
the touch of a button.

Grawl reveals a REMOTE BASE DESTRUCT DEVICE with a big red
button.

Chuck is dumbfounded. A confused private ventures:

CONFUSED PRIVATE 1
General, am I supposed to shoot
Hecknavar or Kolski?

CONFUSED PRIVATE 2
I shoot Kolski!

GRAWL
No, you shoot Meckavoy.

CONFUSED PRIVATE 2
Then who shoots Kolski?

KOLSKI
(offers)
I can shoot myself.

GRAWL
That won't be necessary. Hecknavar,
you shoot Kolski, Captain Kisno and
graze Corporal Hisk.

HECKNAVAR
Yes, Sir!

Hecknavar shoots Corporal Hisk in the leg.

CORPORAL HISK
Ahhhhgh! !

GRAWL
Not yet!
Suddenly all soldiers aim their guns at each other.

KOLSKI
Drop your weapon!

OTHER SOLDIERS
You! No, him first! I'm not taking
my eyes off Kisno! Drop it dirtbag!
A pause. Suddenly, soldiers start shooting and diving for
cover. Chuck looks on, nonplussed. Trying to shout above the
maelstrom:

GRAWL
Hold your fire!!

ANGLE ON CORPORAL HISK at his console. He flips levers,
delivering painful electric shocks to the soldiers who
continue to shoot at each other.

ON Chuck, watching in disbelief. Finally:

GRAWL (CONT'D)
HOLD YOUR FIRE! !!!!!

That finally stops the battle.
GRAWL (CONT'D)
Captain Kizno, get everyone out of
here!

The soldiers start limping away and carrying off the
wounded. Grawl glowers over Chuck.

CHUCK
You're not thinking that's my
fault, right?

GRAWL
Professor Kipple!

Dramatic pause. Kipple enters dressed for surgery.

GRAWL (CONT'D)
He's all yours!

Kipple glows. This is what he's been waiting for. Chuck is
terrified.

cur TO:

EXT. DESERT/GAS STATION - DAY
Lem pulls into the gas station with the team, passing the
huge, 50's-stylized sign.

They get out and look around. There is NOTHING around
anywhere.

They turn to Rover, who's excited, his red tracking light
blinking wildly.

SKIFF
He thinks we found him.

Lem looks around.

LEM
(sad, to himself)
Poor Chuck, I let you down.

cur TO:

INT. BASE 9/OUTSIDE OPERATING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Chuck is strapped to a table. The two mind-controlled
soldiers are wheeled out on gurneys. Their heads are
bandaged. A doctor walks behind them with jars labeled
"brains".

Kipple emerges. He examine's Chuck's skull longingly.

PROFESSOR KIPPLE
A brain even larger than mine. What
must it be capable of!

CHUCK
Dude, it's totally under-utilized.
I spent four years at a party
school. Trust me, it's mush.

PROFESSOR KIPPLE
We'll find out, won't we. I once
had the largest brain on the
planet. Now --
(reveals his instruments)
I'll have the two largest. Mine and
yours.

Kipple nods to the doctors who start to wheel Chuck into the
operating room.

cur TO:
INT. GAS STATION - CONTINUOUS
Lem and the others enter. The place is dilapidated, rundown.

LEM
Hello....! Anyone here!

Suddenly, a rattling SOUND. They turn to see Skiff is trying
to get a display case door open. Inside, a lone, dusty old
candy bar sits on a display stand.

LEM (CONT'D)
What are you doing?

SKIFF
No one's around, I'm not gonna get
in trouble.

Skiff pulls the door open and reaches for the candy bar. As
he picks it up, HOLD ON THE DISPLAY STAND which sinks down.
A low, powerful rumbling begins. The whole building begins
to shake violently. Lem looks at Skiff angrily. Skiff's eyes
goes wide. He quickly takes coins from his pocket and hold
them up, announcing:

SKIFF (CONT'D)
I'm paying! I'm paying!

Suddenly, a monstrous NOISE from out front. They look out to
see:

Slowly, unbelievably, the giant gas station SIGN begins to
flip over. As it heads underground, its other side winds up
on top. Its other side is a ramp that leads downward.

Lem and team are stunned silent.

EXT. GAS STATION - SECONDS LATER

The team steps up to the ramp. There are landing lights
heading downward. A quick look over the edge shows that down
below is a massive army base. It's like an underground city,
teaming with soldiers.

This is BASE 9.
NEERA
There's soldiers everywhere. How

are we gonna get in?

Suddenly, SOUND of a car pulling up. It's Glar and the
teens.
Lem sees them and smiles. He's got an idea.

cur TO:

INT. BASE 9/OPERATING ROOM - A BIT LATER
Chuck is scared. Kipple reveals a scary buzz saw.

CHUCK
(scared)
I don't suppose your planet's
invented Demerol???

Kipple pulls the cord and starts the saw.

EXT. BASE 9 - CONTINUOUS

We say "ext" only because we're outside the Base 9
buildings. But this is really a vast underground space
that's beneath a 200 foot ceiling.

Soldiers are going about their normal routine when they
begin to hear something. It sounds like chanting.

ANGLE ON THE RAMP LEADING DOWN. It's Glar and the teens in
his hippie car. They carry signs that say: LET THE MAN GO! -
STICK IT TO THE MEN, NOT THE MAN - A BRAIN IS A TERRIBLE
THING TO WASTE - MAKE LOVE, NOT INTERSTELLAR WAR!

They chant:

TEENS
One, two, three, four, we don't
want your alien war! (etc.)

After 3 or 4 rounds, a guitar STRUM stops it. REVEAL GLAR,
in full Dylan regalia including an alien harmonica around
his neck. He's starting a song similar to "Times Are A
Changing".

GLAR
Now come all you aliens, don't be
afraid. Your welcome we still are
arranging. We used to think you're
the enemy come. But the times they
are a diff-er-ent.

He gives one blast on the harmonica, then looks up at the
surrounded soldiers. Music stops.

GLAR (CONT'D)
Uh, is being here against the
rules?

ANGLE WIDE behind the soldiers (so's not to see any
violence) as the soldiers attack and the teens flee.

ANGLE BEHIND THE VAN. Lem and team sneak out and make their
way unseen into Base 9.

INT. BASE 9/OPERATING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

About to open Chuck's skull, Professor Kipple guns the
motor, stalling it. It stops dead. Chuck sighs.

EXT. BASE 9/SIDE OF BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

A couple of soldiers guard the front door.

Around the side, the team hides. What to do? Eckle signals
from the side of the building. He's found an air vent. The
others join him. Rover leads the way, tracking Chuck.

INT. BASE 9/VENT SHAFT - CONTINUOUS

The team is in the building ventilation shaft, following
Rover. Rover comes to another grate and pushes it open. They
all crawl out to:

INT. BASE 9/DISPLAY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

There are many glass cases holding displays. Each contains
something that fell out of the sky.

INT. BASE 9/OPERATING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The doctors are gathered around the buzz saw.

DOCTOR 1
Maybe you should give it more gas.

DOCTOR 2
You'll flood it.

DOCTOR 3
What if you open the choke?

Chuck rolls his eyes at these morons. Finally, annoyed:
CHUCK
Oh give me a break! You don't open
the choke 'till after the engine
starts!
The doctors stop. Professor Kipple pulls the cord. The
engine roars back to life. Chuck MOANS at own stupidity.
INT. BASE 9/DISPLAY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Up ahead, Rover points the way to a door.

LEM
It's this way!

They dash out and find the hall empty. They run for it.

INT. BASE 9/OPERATING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Kipple approaches Chuck with the saw. Closer. Closer.
Suddenly, the door bursts open. Lem and team rush in.

So close to his prize, Kipple goes for Chuck's skull. But
he's suddenly sawing metal. In the last second, Rover placed

a metal claw in the way.

The doctors back off. Kipple looks around and furtively
sneaks to the back of the room.

Lem and Neera untie Chuck. He embraces them.

CHUCK
Guys, this is so Luke Skywalker!

Chuck checks his DIGITAL READOUT out. 25 minutes left.

CHUCK (CONT'D)
We gotta book.

LEM
How do we find your ship?

Chuck smiles and flips a switch on Rover. Rover's tracking
light starts flashing.

CHUCK
Rover'll lead us right to it.

Suddenly, a BEEERRRRAAAAP alarm goes off.
EXT. BASE 9/RECOVERY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Kipple has pressed the alarm. He heads out.

EXT. BASE 9 OUTSIDE AREA - CONTINUOUS
The group pokes their heads out. No sign of soldiers.

SKIFF
You think they know where we are?

Suddenly shots ring out and bullets hit nearby.

CHUCK
I'm thinking that's a 'yes'.

They head off. Two soldiers follow.

INT. BASE 9/CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

Grawl comes out of his office, putting on his jacket. He
meets up with the Kipple.

PROFESSOR KIPPLE
General, you must save its brain.

GRAWL
I'm more concerned with saving our
world!

Grawl picks up the REMOTE DESTRUCT DEVICE and looks grim.

EXT. BASE 9/ANOTHER OUTSIDE AREA - CONTINUOUS

Chasing our team, two soldiers round the corner and stop
suddenly when they see:

Neera, standing alone, looking her hippie finest. She holds
three flowers in her hand. They exchange a look. Neera
approaches them.

NEERA
I know you don't really want to
make war.

She puts the stem of a flower in each.
NEERA (CONT'D)

This one's for peace.
(next flower)
This one's for love.

With a flower in each of their rifles, they look at the
third in her hand.

SOLDIER 4
What's that for?

Suddenly, Chuck comes up behind them.

CHUCK
That's for you.

He punches one. He holds his hand and GROANS in pain. Lem
punches the other and holds his hand too. As the team runs
on Chuck bemoans his sore hand:

CHUCK (CONT'D)
They make it look so easy in the
movies!

INT. BASE 9/RECOVERY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The two mind-controlled soldiers are sitting up in their
beds, legs crossed casually, sipping beverages from paper
cups as if they were at a cocktail party. They each have
massive bandages on their empty heads.

SOLDIER 1
That professor's a genius!
SOLDIER 2
I feel positively effervescent.
SOLDIER 1
In fine fettle. What a salubrious
experience!
SOLDIER 2

Well said. Cheers.

They "clink" paper cups, crushing them completely, yet
continuing to mime drinking as if they still held water.

(NOTE: This scene might make a great button during or after
the closing credits.)
EXT. BASE 9/MAIN HANGER - MOMENTS LATER

Following Rover, the team reaches this massive hanger. They
look around, confused. Neera taps Lem and points to:
CHUCK'S SHIP. They approach in wonder. It's a great sight.

LEM
How do we get it out of here?

In answer, Eckle finds a control panel hanging from a long
chain. He presses it, causing the roof overhead to split and
start to open, revealing the sky above. A beautiful moment.
They all look up, thrilled.

Some affectionate chucks on the shoulder for Eckle.

CHUCK
Way to go, kid.

Suddenly:

GRAWL (0.S.)
Step away from the flying saucer
and put your hands in the air!

They turn and see Grawl. Next to him, Kipple. Then, the
whole army shows up. In short order, they're surrounded.

The team exchanges a look. They're trapped. Grawl steps up.
He holds up the destruct button.

GRAWL (CONT'D)
You never had a chance.

Grawl flips the "ready" button. Destruct devices around the
room arm themselves.

CHUCK
You'd destroy the whole base just
to get me?

NEERA
That's sick!

CHUCK
(aside)
Actually, it's kind of flattering.

GRAWL

Sick, young lady, is helping the
enemy of your world! Sick is
befriending a creature that's so
completely -- different!! Sick is -

(points to Chuck)
Well look, it's right in front of
you!

(to Kipple)
I'm sorry, Professor, it's too
dangerous to let the alien live
another minute.

THROUGH GRAWL'S POV, his scope on Chuck's head, we SUDDENLY
SEE LEM STEP IN FRONT.

Lem approaches the General gingerly, trying to have a heart
to heart talk. As he talks, he gets closer and closer.

LEM

General, I know what you're afraid
of. I understand, I'm afraid of it
too. It's not Chuck. It's not
aliens or monsters. It's something
even scarier. It's the unknown.
I've spent my whole life running
from it. And I think maybe you have
too. But the unknown isn't
something to be afraid of.

(with a smile at Chuck)
It can be your best friend.

(to Grawl)
And just when you think it means
the end of everything you know...

(a sly look at his team)
It's really just the beginning.

Lem suddenly grabs the REMOTE BASE DESTRUCT DEVICE and
presses the red button.

A frozen moment. Grawl stares in disbelief. Lem can't even
believe it. And suddenly:

THE BASE ALARM SOUNDS. They hear:

LOUDSPEAKER VOICE
Base destruct, two minutes.

The soldiers all stare in horror. They exchange looks. Lem
turns to Kipple.

LEM
What are you looking at? Run!!!

Kipple runs. Other soldiers follow and soon they're all
fleeing except Grawl.

Grawl stares in disbelief. Then, furious, he aims his gun
right at Lem...

.Â»-. Suddenly his arm is grabbed. It's Neera.
NEERA
That's my boyfriend!!!

She punches Grawl. Grawl is stunned, but not knocked out.
He's about to raises his gun again. This time it's Eckle who
jumps in, swinging the control panel, knocking Grawl out.

As the room empties of soldiers, Lem turns to Chuck.

LEM
Let's go!

CHUCK
Everyone on board!

The team rushes for the ship.

INT. CHUCK'S SHIP - CONTINUOUS
Chuck starts all systems. But he grimaces.

LEM
What's the matter?

CHUCK
No time for auto pilot.
(realizes)
I'm gonna have to fly this thing!
(pressing buttons)
I am so putting in for overtime.

A bit nervous, he starts pressing buttons. SOUND of the ship
powering up.

LOUDSPEAKER VOICE
Base destruct, 1 minute.

Chuck gets ready to lift off. But then he notices Grawl
unconscious on the floor.

ON THE HATCH as Lem and Skiff ready to pull it shut.
CHUCK
(grudgingly)
Wait....
EXT. BASE 9/MAIN HANGER - CONTINUOUS
Chuck bolts out the ship and heads for Grawl.

Skiff and Lem poke their heads out.
SKIFF
What're you doing?

CHUCK

I can't leave him here!
SKIFF

Why?
LEM

(smiles, re: Chuck)
â€˜Cause he's got the Right Stuff.

Lem steps out to help. They get Grawl on board.

LOUDSPEAKER VOICE
Base destruct, 15 seconds...

They close the ship's hatch.

INT. CHUCK'S SHIP - CONTINUOUS
CHUCK
This is gonna be rough!
EXT. BASE 9/MAIN HANGER - CONTINUOUS

LOUDSPEAKER VOICE
Base destruct, 10 seconds. 9. 8...

The engines start. Slowly, too slowly, the ship starts to
lift.
INT. CHUCK'S SHIP - CONTINUOUS

CHUCK
She's heavy!

He hits the throttle.

EXT. BASE 9/MAIN HANGER - CONTINUOUS
The ship is starting to pick up momentum.

LOUDSPEAKER VOICE
4. 3. 2.

EXT. GAS STATION - CONTINUOUS
All the soldiers, Glar and the Teens have gotten out of the
base and stand watching as....

THERE'S A MASSIVE RUMBLING AND EXPLOSIONS BELOW.

Before them, a volcano-like EXPLOSION from the ground. They
stare in horror until...

They see a ship emerge, flying out just ahead of the flames.
The NASA capsule launches precariously upward.

ON THE TEENS, cheering.

ON KIPPLE, as the the mind-controlled soldiers step up.

SOLDIER 1
Doc, that brain operation was
inspired!

SOLDIER 2

You simply must try it!
As they take him away, Kipple looks around. It's clear he
can't get away from them.
INT. CHUCK'S SHIP - CONTINUOUS
ON CHUCK, piloting, proud that he did it.
Quickly, the view changes. Blue sky becomes black space and
stars. A magical moment as they break orbit and make it to
space.

They all stare out in awe.

Chuck releases Lem's strap, causing Lem to float up in zero
gravity. The others join him.

Lem floats to the window, where he looks out at the view of
a lifetime. Chuck floats next to him.

CHUCK
Whatta you think?

LEM
What a big universe!!
(looks at Chuck, smiles)
I am definitely coming back here!

General Grawl wakes up and sees where they are, sees he's
weightless.
GRAWL
Are you going to take over my mind?

CHUCK
You can keep it.

ECKLE
General, you've been reading too
many comic books.

CHUCK
(to all)
Strap in everyone, I'm taking you

home.

Grawl stares in wonder at everyone floating back to their
seats. It's a marvel and he allows a small smile.

Chuck starts to bring the ship down for a landing.

From their POV, they get closer and closer to the planet.
Below, a continent, a vast stretch of land, suburbia and
finally...

EXT. TOWN HALL - DAY

Chuck's ship lands. People approach warily. Police cars pull
up and officers aim their guns, including Chief Gorloc.

The hatch opens. Lem and gang step out, followed by Grawl
and finally by Chuck. The police aim their guns at Chuck.
Grawl steps in front of him.

GRAWL
It's all right, Chief. He's with
me.
(turns to Chuck)
Captain... Thanks for saving my
life.

Grawl salutes Chuck, who smiles and salutes back.

CHUCK
A pleasure, General. Maybe next
time you have guests, you'll throw
a better party.

As Chuck turns to Eckle, more people arrive. Among them,
Lem's parents. They run up and hug him. Eckle's parents
arrive and embrace Neera. The onlookers see Chuck acting
friendly and watch, curious.
CHUCK (CONT'D)
(to Eckle)
Kid, how'd you like to be president
of the Planet One Chuck Baker fan
club?

Eckle nods, proudly. Chuck reaches into his suit and pulls
out a massive stack of SIGNED HEADSHOTS.

Chuck rises and sees Skiff. Then, he turns to Rover.

CHUCK (CONT'D)
Rover, you coming or you want to
stay here?

Rover looks at Chuck and again at Skiff. He decides and
sidles up to Skiff with love.

CHUCK (CONT'D)
(to Skiff)
He needs oil every 3000 miles and a
whole lotta love.

Skiff is overjoyed that Rover gets to stay. They jump around
together.

Now the crowd is filling in. Chuck checks his DIGITAL
READOUT and looks around anxiously for...

Lem, who's across the crowd, looking for Chuck. Through the
throng they meet eyes and smile.

They approach, stand before each other smiling wordlessly.
Then:

CHUCK (CONT'D)
Lem, you saved my life.

LEM
(a smile)
You saved mine too.

Neera joins Lem. Chuck turns to her.

CHUCK
You got a good man there.

NEERA
(smiles)
I know.

Chuck turns back to Lem. They hug. Then Chuck heads for his
ship. At the door, he turns back to Lem.
CHUCK
You ever make it to earth, I'm in
the phone book.

Chuck gets in his ship. Everyone backs away.

To a great swell of MUSIC, the ship takes off. People wave
good-bye.

ON LEM, watching, moved. He and Neera exchange a look and
they kiss. Skiff and Rover see this, both touched. Skiff
dabs his eyes with a handkerchief and hands it to Rover who
does the same.

FADE OUT

THE END
